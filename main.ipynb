Went to the bathroom and ran it under water, but it just kept bleeding. I didn't know what to do and was too drunk to try to deal with it, so I just wrapped my hand in a towel and tried to go to sleep.\\n\\nWoke up to knocking at my door and it ended up being security. He followed a trail of blood from the bathroom to my room and wanted to make sure I was alright. I showed him my finger and he was like, \"Come on, you gotta go to the hospital.\" Dude was a bro and drove me there even though it was like 3am. Saw a doctor and he had to give me a bunch of stitches. He said I was very lucky because if it was just a tiny bit deeper I would have probably had done permanant damage and lost mobility of the finger.\\n\\nNow I have [this scar on my finger shaped like a Nike swoosh](https://i.imgur.com/cEhQRG0.jpg) to remind me not to be stupid and try to fight glass.\n"
