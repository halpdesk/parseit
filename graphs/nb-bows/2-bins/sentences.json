So I called for a taxi, filled out a notice of termination, and handed it to him. He looked absolutely shocked. Then he defiantly protested that only <CEO> could fire him.

I've already marked it up, English teacher style with a red pen and start with, \"I had some trouble understanding your report.\" I proceeded to go error by error for the purpose of \"clarifying\" the report. He's getting redder and redder. I then go into trying to determine why he pulled over the defendant because it's unclear in the report. He's not able to give a definitive response.\n\nAll the while, the sherriff's rep, whom I've worked with a lot and who I have seen be very vocal protecting deputies in interviews like this in the past, is silent.

I would also like to add that if anybody reads this, and you feel somewhat lost while in the Military, don\u2019t be afraid to go to medical and talk about it. It happens unfortunately often where speaking directly to your chain of command will not help things and word can travel fast.

Pills and some whiskey on the dresser, ready to go, a note next to it signed and everything. \n\nBut then I saw Benvolio. \n\nHe was sitting next to an empty food bowl and was staring at me apparently hungry and waiting for the person he loved and trusted most to feed and play with him. So I got up real quick, fed him, and then sat back down to stare at what I planned to kill myself with. \n\nAnd then I just couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I cried. I cried a lot thinking about what would happen to him when I was gone and  how confused he would be when I didn\u2019t wake back up to feed him the next morning. So I didn\u2019t do it. \n\nI got black out drunk instead. But I woke up the next morning, saw my cats empty bowl, and was glad, for a brief second, for the first time in a long time. \n\nIt\u2019s been about a year, and I\u2019m still working to put my life into a place and order where I won\u2019t be as anxious all of the time. But I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not dead, and it feels now for the first time in a while like happiness is a feasible reality instead of an impossible fantasy. \n\nI won\u2019t pretend to know anyone else\u2019s pain, but I feel comfortable saying that it\u2019s not worth killing yourself.
