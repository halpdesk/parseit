This went on for a bit, when I realized that it wasn\u2019t stuck, but being pulled. I looked into the dim area just past the illumination of the street light and spied my father, crouched over and tugging the hose. Well I did the only reasonable thing to do, and I sprayed him. He yelled and ran inside with me chasing. \n\nOnce he got inside he made a face and goes \u201cYou can\u2019t get me now!

Remember at one point your widgets were the greatest, don't try and keep up with your neighbors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Relationships**\n\n* Don't burn bridges, no matter how obscure they are. It might be satisfying to get shit off your chest and tell people off as you're leaving a gig or a job, but it's a really small world. Really. You will be shocked at how connected everyone is these days and who talks to who. \n* Be kind.\n* Read Dale Carnegie's book How to Win Friends and Influence People. There are some audio book versions on youtube you can listen to. Some of the examples are out of date (like letters and calling cards...) but the sentiment is not. It is single handedly the keys to success in interpersonal relationships at work, school, or in your love life. \n* Listen more than you talk, and don't just wait for your time to talk in a conversation.   \n\n\n**Self Help / Self Improvement**\n\n* Always improve.\n* Read a book. \n* Keep a journal occasionally. It's good for reflection on how far you've come.   \n\n\n**Sex**\n\n* Is awesome.\n* babies are forever. Use protection if you\u2019re not ready for them. I love mine, but I am 30 - you might not want a baby until later if you even want one at all. \n* Don't put it on a pedestal. If it's the only reason you're into someone, chances are that relationship isnt going to last.\n* STDs are mostly permeant, just wear a condom or make your partner wear one...\n* People have sex, don't shame people for the number of partners they have had (or haven't?). In fact, nothing good comes out of even asking someone you're interested in the question of how many women they've slept with.    \n\n\n**Cars**\n\n* you don't need the greatest car in the world. \n* don't waste your money on a new car.  1 owner trade in if you're looking for new fancy tech. 7 year, 70k mile, $7k price tag is about the car you should be chasing. \n* learn how the car works\n* dont be afraid to get a second estimate for car repairs\n* car insurance is stupid expensive, and the \"it drops at 25\" is a myth. \n* don't let people borrow your car. you're liable for whatever happens. \n* don't cheap out on tires or brakes. if you have tire/ brake problems with your car, get them fixed.  \n\n\n**Drugs / Alcohol**\n\n* if you do drugs, don't make it your life. pot is not a lifestyle, it's a drug. nobody likes \"that guy\" who doesn't shut up about drugs. same goes for booze / liquor.\n* some shit will seriously ruin your body, just be careful \n* learn your limits and stay within them while drinking. nobody likes a drunk. \n* dont get behind the wheel of a car after drinking - this WILL ruin your life. have a plan. a $200 dollar taxi trip is wayyy cheaper than bail + legal fees for DUI/DWI.  \n\n\n**Job Satisfaction**\n\n* don't stay in a job you hate. \n* find something you can enjoy. it sounds silly but it helps to find something positive about your line of work. if you can't, work towards a new career. \n* value yourself and your time. dont let work walk all over you.   \n\n\n**Clothes**\n\n* wash them, learn to do laundry regardless of what gender you are\n* dont worry about brands. buy brands because they are quality, and last - don't buy clothes that have excessive rips and tears (oh god i sound old... i promise they were super cool to me when I was a teen) clothes get really expensive\n* buy something dressy, but not too flashy. Button down with a tie, matching slacks, a belt, and some dress socks/shoes. make sure it fits. if you can afford it, get something dark/neutral colored for attending funerals, and something pleasant for attending weddings. These clothes don't have to be really expensive.   \n\n\n**Mental Health / Fitness**\n\n* check in on your friends. vent to professionals, not to your friends.\n* smile often, it helps. \n* life is awesome, it gets better, and this too shall pass. time really does heal all wounds, it may be miserable now but it will get better. \n* Go for a walk every now and then.

My coworker brought a lot of experience and skills to the table so many executives and bosses want him working on their projects in their departments in their umbrella of the company. When it was time for him to ask for a raise, our manager, director, and executive director turned him down and low balled him with a counter offer so insultingly low he started looking for jobs outside of the company.\n\nCFO, and other senior VPs heard about said move and reached out to him to get him to stay, and they worked it out amongst each other so they can share him in their special projects along with a hefty compensation package.\n\nCoworker being respectful puts in a request to transfer that has to be approved by the current manager, director, and executive director which they promptly turned down. To make matters worse, they go ahead and write him up for \"attendance\" problems from a couple of months ago... We're all salary, and for the most part project based.\n\nThroughout all of this, I am a fly on the wall since we shared an office, here I am laughing with him while he was in phone calls with the literal people who ran the company. He was told to ignore all that, they apologized to him, they got VP of Human Relations in on the meeting explained the situation which then launched an internal investigation unbeknownst to the 3 clowns.\n\nthe ensuing shit storm that came down onto the 3 clowns is more than enough to make this story awesome, but the cherry on top, is that he is now their boss...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr: \"management\" team tries to screw over an employee who ends up being their boss.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE**: thank you for the award, and as a thank you, I will share the rest of the tea, sorry for the delay. \n\nthe way it would've worked before all this went down, is that, said executive director was gonna be promoted into a VP position and move into the big player's lounge in our main office, director which is clown#2 would've taken EXECdir spot, and clown#3 which was manager would've taken director job. \n\nThe powers that may be, CFO, senior VPs that were working behind the scenes took this opportunity to let the clowns dig a hole for themselves.  and to everybody's delight, they did. \n\nI'm going to start with the matter at hand, CFO and senior VPs told my coworker to sit tight, and they will make sure that he is taken care of, and that he from then on will be only taking instructions from them, with the VP of HR on the phone, the process of re-routing him up the chain of command went super fast. I mean why wouldn't it, the bosses who would've reviewed and approved all this have been working behind the scenes to make it happen and they are all on the phone now. My coworker was told that by the next business day he just had to fill in the proper paperwork and to send it straight to VP of HR, and formal announcements will be made to the rest of the company by the end of the week. My coworker then asked the bosses to use some of his newly granted compensation for a vacation week, just to avoid the drama.  \n\nTHIS WEEK was glorious. The clowns were busy calling my coworker, blowing up his phone. LOVING the drama that was going on, I was texting him updates. Since clown #1,2, and 3 always relied on us salaried grunts to take care of everything for them, their incompetence kept showing in their \"BIG\" projects. Projects that have to be submitted to the same CFO and senior VPs that caused all this for them. Every one of our internal clients (other departments, execs, and bosses within the company) was looking for my coworker, the incompetency of the clowns have spread across at the management level, they are all now bypassing them and going straight to us to get things done. \n\nHR was prompted by the VP of HR to start investigations in the background and we were all interviewed and sworn to secrecy. \n\nThe end of the week comes, and my coworker comes in, brand new suit, sits on his desk, and we start our usual banter.  This is supposed to be the day of the big announcement. Clown #3 calls my coworker into the office to write him up for as many things as clown #3 can. \\*\\*\\*\\*THIS I CANNOT CONFIRM because I'm only hearing this from my coworker\\*\\*\\*\\* but apparently clown#3 was putting the book down on him, and threatened termination due to the number of offenses (they wouldn't have fired him, they needed him that much)\n\nMy coworker has a habit of giving a deadpan face and just shrugging through everything that is not interesting to him, so apparently that's what he did. \n\nWhat I can confirm is that after this meeting, he showed me an email of said clown#3 scheduling a meeting with him and clown #2, and #1. WHICHHHH HE DECLINES IN FRONT OF ME...he laughs, looks at me, says watch this,  he walks out, and after some time comes back into the building with the Senior VP straight to clown#1's office Exec Dir.\n\nsome time passes and it was fun to watch Clown #2 Director, and Clown #3 Manager rush to the same office. \n\nThey were all passed over for the promotions, were not granted their raises, and now all their projects go to my coworker for approval. \n\nI no longer work for the company, after some more drama I have moved on as well. I'm still in touch with my coworker, the last update I have heard is that clown #1 and #2 exec director and director would be retiring this year after so long with the company. \n\nI heard that #3 burnt the team to the ground due to sheer incompetence, and is on the way out as well. #3 started the team with a total of 9 direct reports now down to 2.",
