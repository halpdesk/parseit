We had one plane that had an issue on takeoff and veered off the runway, it cartwheeled and totaled the airplane but fortunately the pilot was not serious injured.  I had a student who was next in line for takeoff when it happened, he called me from his phone as it happened.  I hopped in the airport car with one of the rampers and drove out to the plane with a radio to inform inbound planes to use the other runway (we had no control tower).  On the way to the runway I called the airport manager who drove to the airport and on his way he made a phone call to officially closed that runway.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later a metric fuckton of DPS officers showed up and immediately tried to close the whole airport, treating it like a giant crime scene.  They were carelessley driving around the airport like they owned the place, ignoring the planes that were moving around, and crossing our only open runway without regard to inbound traffic.  A mechanic and I tried to tell them to be careful and they got mad at us.  One of them told me they were \"locking it down\" a couple times, meaning the whole airport.  Now I was a broke ass flight instructor and I had a flight that afternoon that was ultimately going to help pay for me to eat that week.\n\nThe airport manager was a short stereotypical country guy, also former Navy.  He was not intimidated at all by the cops trying to close his airport.  When he showed up I was about to go out with a student who was preflighting for a cross-country.  There were about 5 cops in the lobby, me with my flight bag, the airport manager, and a mechanic.  One of the cops saw my flight bag and said \"I don't know why you have that or why he's out a the plane, you aren't going anywhere\", the moment he finished his sentence the airport manager said \"it's one runway that's closed, the airport is still open.  This pissed off the cops.\n\nI was about to head out the door, and one of the officers said he was driving out to the disabled plane.  Idky, the pilot had been gone for about an hour.  The mechanic said \"you need to be careful\" and the cop quickly retorted \"AND WHY THE HELL IS THAT?\" and he said \"because this is still an airport, and the first thing that hits you is going to be a propeller\" a few seconds later a plane took off as one of the cars was approaching the runway intersection ironing in that point.\n\nI walked out, and as I was hopping in the plane with my student the same cop came up to me and said \"you aren't going anywhere, we're locking this down!\"  I looked at the airport manager who followed all of us out to the ramp, he said \"have a nice flight AjaxBU!\" \n\nYou could see these cops just fuming that they didn't have the authority to close down an entire airport because one plane went off the runway.   The airport had two runways, where the disabled plane was located was probably a mile or so away from the open runway.  Why they were making a big fuss, I don't know.  The occupant was relatively uninjured, his wife was the worst thing he had to deal with that day, he told her he wasn't going to fly.\n\nWe had a good flight, and I got to eat dinner that week.",

                "sent": "\nIt\u2019s finally my time to shine!!\n\nIt was Christmas Day, 2010. I was 10, my brother was 12. I was in that stage of my life where I greatly admired my brother, and basically followed him around and did what he ordered me to do.\n\nAt this given moment, my nan and her boyfriend were at the table sitting outside enjoying the sunshine and listening to Mariah Carey. My mum,  preparing the Christmas feast of ham and roast veg. My dad, probably trying to figure out how to make ice with the new ice machine and cursing his existence.\n\nNow for a little more context, I\u2019ve grown up in the Australian suburbs. This is important to reference, as it explains why my brother and I were trying to peep over the fence to see what our loud neighbours were doing. You\u2019re probably confused...I\u2019ll explain. In Australia, it\u2019s common culture to extend to your neighbours, or the entire street, an invitation into the family.\n\nThis includes inviting them over to celebrate birthdays, having afternoon siestas on the front lawn, joint Australia Day bbqs, that kind of thing.\nHowever, my family was never really close to the neighbours behind us. I personally feel like this is because they never cut their bloody tree that\u2019s palms dipped into our yard. \n\nAnyway, on this particular Christmas, those neighbours were being louder than usual. My brother, being the nosey bastard he is, decided he wanted to see what the commotion was all about. So he decided he had a plan; get a chair, put it against the fence and look over. \n\nBut alas, this plan would not work, as the way the chair was positioned, my brother would surely topple over. Cue my involvement. I sat down in that chair as if my life depended on it. My brother needed my help, so I\u2019d be sure to give it. I watched as my brother climbed the chair, using the headrest as a step. \nHe peered over. \nI caught my breath. \nIt felt like eternity before my brother started to jitter and panic. \n\n\n\n\u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?!\u201d\n\n\n\nHOLY TURTLE DOVES, \nI thought, as my brother clambered down the fence. The bloody neighbours had seen his boof of a head peering into their yard. Now panicking as well, I yelled at my brother to hurry down so I could runaway myself, but that wasn\u2019t before the incident occurred.\n\nThe life changing moment that gave me my scar.\n\nI bet you\u2019re wondering how it happened? Did my brother somehow topple the chair over and make me fall, cutting my hand on the pot plant below? No. Or did the neighbour throw over a cricket ball in anger, it landing on my head and causing me to bleed and have a little Harry Potter scar?\n\nNot even close. \n\nAs my brother rushed down from the fence, his feet came too close to my face. His big toe specifically. And in a moment you could say was set on 0.75 speed, his toe nail collided with my cheek, cutting my face.\n\nHe landed safely on the floor and ran to the outdoor table, including himself in my nan and her partner\u2019s conversation as if nothing happened. But I knew something was wrong. My bloody face was burning!\n\nI abandoned the chair and the yells of fury behind me and darted for the bathroom. I looked in horror at my new battle wound.\n\nMy god, I looked like a prisoner you wouldn\u2019t want to fuck with. The cut resembled la teardrop. Almost exactly so. It was rather fascinating in a way. But the stinging overcame the wonderment.\n\nI cleaned the wound as best as I could, being 10 years old and not very bright, and stuck a band aid on it. I know.\n\nI walked out and copied my brother; sitting at the table and acting like nothing happened. Of course everyone picked up on the bandaid, but I simply said I wanted to be a Christmas Pirate (doesn\u2019t make any sense? I know) and they moved on.\n\nTo this day, I have that scar. Yes, it still resembles a tear drop.",

                "sent": "I'm 39.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#1. Life is work. \n\nEverything requires perpetual maintenance. All elements of your life, be they self-care, friendships, relationships, work-life balance, health, your house, your car, bank accounts, etc. require **constant** repair. This is our attempt at slowing down entropy. We'll never stop it, as the [energy of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2iTCm0xpDc) is constantly trying to seek perfect equilibrium, and our efforts only last a lifetime. If you wish to be even *remotely* successful in life, you will recognize how much work you will need to put into every little thing. Otherwise, you'll end up like me: alone, unloved, unhealthy, and ready to die at a moment's notice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#2. \"Know thyself.\"\n\nIf you don't know who you are, you're gonna have a bad time. You need to understand that your life is HEAVILY impacted by various forms of luck: where you live; how much money your family has; how abusive your family is; the school system's resources; the literal air that you are breathing. These all have an impact on your life, and the possibility of your future life. The opportunities or obstacles of your life are LARGELY dictated by simple factors of luck. Not all, but I'll get to that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#3. \"Be yourself\"...is horseshit.\n\nIf you don't know who you are, *how the hell can you be yourself\u203d* How do you overcome this catch-22? \n\nA better variant, IMO, is ***\"be the person you wish to become\"***. Not a living or dead person that you hope to magically morph into. But the person that you, in your mind, wish to be in the future. \n\nDo you want to [be kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sicUhD1n-es), or ruthless? Do you want to be respected, or feared? To you want to help, or hurt? Those are broad and vague, and there are many many more, but they're starting points for how to approach your future. If you've decided to be ruthless, then you'll begin to adapt behaviors that go that route. If you're a meek and timid person who can't even say their name clearly (been there, done that, relevant username now), you're not likely to command any kind of respect.\n\nIf who you are right now is not what you want to be, then \"being yourself\" is the worst advice you'll receive. You must change yourself, because whether you like it or not, change occurs, and you can't control the majority of those changes. So change the ones you *can*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#4. Friends come and go.\n\nThe reason you have friends *right now* is because of geographic (and, to a not-to-be-dismissed degree, socioeconomic) reasons. Once you stop going to the same schools, and movie theaters, and book stores, and restaurants, etc. the friendships will begin to diminish. You will more likely grow apart over time, not together. It's possible, sure. But don't make any heavy bets, because you'll lose money on those bets more often than not.\n\nYou'll need to find new ways of making friends. College is yet another school-related location that can help. Clubs help. Hobby-related activities help. \n\nRight before COVID lockdowns here in LA, I made a friend with my tattoo artist, barely knew him otherwise. He mentioned he and his friends were gonna start watching crappy 80's horror movies on the weekend. I was down. Then the lockdowns hit, and we couldn't do it. And I'm bad at making friends with new people I've barely met, so I've made no attempts to reconnect. Maybe when I get back to the tattoo shop. Goes back to point #1.\n\nMaking friends will be hard. But if you're lucky, and make enough connections, it won't be *as hard*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#5. \"Expect the best, prepare for the worst.\"\n\nHaving a positive outlook is healthy. If you're perpetually despondent, hopeless, and listless, you probably have depression, and that needs tending to. But ONLY having a positive outlook will lead you to trouble. You must prepare for the times when life throws a wrench into your car tire. Saving money is necessary. Blowing it all and wondering how you're gonna eat next week is pointless drama you've placed upon yourself. Get a checking account, a savings account, and a retirement account. Even if you only put $10 / week into the thing, AND LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE, you'll likely have a nice rainy day fund when the shit hits the fan. \n\nLiving in a fire-prone region? make sure you have proper equipment in case wildfires become too dangerous. Earthquake kits, first aid kits, bottled water, blankets, etc. \n\nIf you don't live in a place with reliable mass transit, best make sure you have a car that's in good working order. In that car, ensure you have a fresh spare tire (replace tires every 5 years, unless otherwise indicated by professionals). Know how to change a tire: loosen those lugnuts FIRST, then jack up the car, remove tire, replace tire, tighten lug nuts with wrench, lower the car SLOWLY AND SAFELY, finish tightening lugnuts, etc. Know how to bleed brakes (get a friend to help). Replace wipers and fluid before the rainy season as needed. SO much car care is necessary, going back to point #1.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#6. Kissing ass and networking are IMPORTANT.\n\nIf you think you're going to have a *remotely* successful life, you're going to be kissing a LOT of ass. It doesn't mean completely shoving your nose up someone's ass, but sometimes it might. If you are regularly on someone's radar in a good way, especially someone with an inkling of power, you're going to be one of the first people they think of for a promotion or raise or relocation to an exotic land. You're going to have to wear a lot of \"masks\" when you're around various people. Or you could just become like me and avoid that, keep your \"self respect\", and be poor and ignored. \n\nI was \"discovered\" last year. Like, legit. I was on a podcast with a coworker (I was the interviewee), and **an executive producer of one of the nation's largest morning shows** heard the podcast. He found me a month later, talked to me, and helped me get started. He gave me a lot of advice that I never used (regarding kissing ass, etc.), because I'm a fuck up. After a month, he dropped me, told me I needed to \"be my own cheerleader\". Coulda been a host on the radio in Los Angeles, but I'm not.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#7. Hard Work & Luck.\n\nLuck starts your journey, hard work continues it. Anyone successful who doesn't say they are lucky (or outright refuses to acknowledge it) are not people to look up to. [Survivorship Bias](https://xkcd.com/1827/) is a huge factor. If you look at all the people who've worked hard and were successful, and then found everyone else who did similar, but aren't successful, you can factor in luck for the successful. Every. Single. Time. This [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&vl) better explains everything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#8. \"No man is an island.\"\n\nYou can't do this alone. Everyone who gets anywhere in life is doing it with the help of others. They could be supportive parents. Friends who love them for who they are. Teachers that see the possibilities. Employers who see growth. Coworkers that empower their workday. Baristas at the coffee shop with a smile. Strangers on the train who hold the door for 1 extra second (don't go nuts on this one, people, there's a threshold). If you are surrounded by supportive and loving people, life, in all its difficulties and flaws and foibles, will become much less work. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#9. Life is a game.\n\nIf you don't play, you lose. If you don't play by the rules, you lose. If you don't play well with others, you lose. No matter how much you want it or not, you're in the game. You have no choice. And your only opponent is you. Goes back to #6, and ties in with #8. And despite how shitty the game is, again, if you choose not to play, you will reap zero rewards. You might get a ball to the face, too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#10. Iroh\n\n[\"While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZZXAvHySQ4)\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\n#I have failed at all 10 of these points. Don't be like me.\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\ntl;dr - read it anyway. I just gave you multiple summaries of life. I'm not summarizing my summaries, dammit!
