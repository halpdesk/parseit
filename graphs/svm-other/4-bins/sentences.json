When she got up to the head of the line to place her order, she said something along the lines of how slow and ineffectual he was, to which he responded something along the lines of \u201cwe\u2019re going as the fast as we can, here\u2019s your drink, have a nice evening\u201d (through gritted teeth I\u2019m sure), which led her into the following diatribe: \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re nothing but a bunch of dumbass kids - don\u2019t you have any adults back there working this wedding? I want to talk to your manager or the owner or someone who\u2019s an adult who can get you out of here and get the job done right.\u201d To which a huge shit-ass-eating grin washed over his face as he replied, \u201cHi! My name (his name). I am the owner of this catering company, please note that if you would like for me to go, then this reception will have no food or beverages or bar service.\u201d \n\nI swear you could almost hear a hype crew descending from the heavens shouting \u201cOHHHHHHH!!!\u201d after he said it.

I was just talking about lack of those major separators we had as children like summer vacation, new school, your first kiss, etc. Due to those major separators missing I don't recall if I did something a year ago or 3 years ago. It's a little blurry if something happened 2 weeks ago or 4 months ago.  This is because once you have a career and a home you're doing a lot of similar things most days(work, chores, cooking,  hobbies, etc).
