Christians, Jews, and Muslims only believe in one god so calling their god \"God\" never had the problem of becoming confusing. Though I know certain sect of Christians call him Jehovah, which seems to be an anglicized version of YHWH. And also Allah is just Arabic for God, it's not another name for him.

This is our average technology sales numbers for the weeks you are on shift. See this number over here? This is our average technology sales numbers for weeks you are not. At this point, it would be more cost effective for me to simply fire you. What do you think of that solution?\"\n\nThe guy stammers and stutters like a toddler caught bullying another kid on the playground. Fortunately, the dude wasn't fired, but the store manager made it clear that when I was on shift, I was not to leave the technology department unless I was on break or there was a fire in the store.

When that happens it fucking creeps me out so I won't sleep the rest of the night.\n\nEdit 1: Why don't I move or cover the mirror? The first time it happened, I covered the mirror but with my morning rushes to work, I pull the cloth down to get ready, and then cover it when I reach home. I've had and still have peaceful nights of sleep (with dimmed lights on) so eventually I'd skip on covering mirror and focussed more not being afraid of the dark. When I least expect it, I then I catch myself waking up to the mirror with a gentle head bump/nod. Get spooked at the incident, rinse and repeat with a blanket cover. I generally have good nights of sleep, these sleepwalks are very rare so I'm really I'm more concerned about my fear of sleeping in the dark. I can't do it. I need a dimmed light for bedtime.\n\nEdit 2: Is it this particular mirror in my room? Yes, it's always this mirror but maybe I haven't had enough sleepovers to have another sleepwalking state elsewhere. I think it's just my subconscious self remembering how I like the mirror during the daytime to get ready, do my hair, makeup, try clothes, etc. I live in a shared flat so I can only leave it in my room. It's a cheap full length mirror and anyway, these sleep walks are so rare.

                "sent": "I'm 39.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#1. Life is work. \n\nEverything requires perpetual maintenance. All elements of your life, be they self-care, friendships, relationships, work-life balance, health, your house, your car, bank accounts, etc. require **constant** repair. This is our attempt at slowing down entropy. We'll never stop it, as the [energy of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2iTCm0xpDc) is constantly trying to seek perfect equilibrium, and our efforts only last a lifetime. If you wish to be even *remotely* successful in life, you will recognize how much work you will need to put into every little thing. Otherwise, you'll end up like me: alone, unloved, unhealthy, and ready to die at a moment's notice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#2. \"Know thyself.\"\n\nIf you don't know who you are, you're gonna have a bad time. You need to understand that your life is HEAVILY impacted by various forms of luck: where you live; how much money your family has; how abusive your family is; the school system's resources; the literal air that you are breathing. These all have an impact on your life, and the possibility of your future life. The opportunities or obstacles of your life are LARGELY dictated by simple factors of luck. Not all, but I'll get to that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#3. \"Be yourself\"...is horseshit.\n\nIf you don't know who you are, *how the hell can you be yourself\u203d* How do you overcome this catch-22? \n\nA better variant, IMO, is ***\"be the person you wish to become\"***. Not a living or dead person that you hope to magically morph into. But the person that you, in your mind, wish to be in the future. \n\nDo you want to [be kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sicUhD1n-es), or ruthless? Do you want to be respected, or feared? To you want to help, or hurt? Those are broad and vague, and there are many many more, but they're starting points for how to approach your future. If you've decided to be ruthless, then you'll begin to adapt behaviors that go that route. If you're a meek and timid person who can't even say their name clearly (been there, done that, relevant username now), you're not likely to command any kind of respect.\n\nIf who you are right now is not what you want to be, then \"being yourself\" is the worst advice you'll receive. You must change yourself, because whether you like it or not, change occurs, and you can't control the majority of those changes. So change the ones you *can*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#4. Friends come and go.\n\nThe reason you have friends *right now* is because of geographic (and, to a not-to-be-dismissed degree, socioeconomic) reasons. Once you stop going to the same schools, and movie theaters, and book stores, and restaurants, etc. the friendships will begin to diminish. You will more likely grow apart over time, not together. It's possible, sure. But don't make any heavy bets, because you'll lose money on those bets more often than not.\n\nYou'll need to find new ways of making friends. College is yet another school-related location that can help. Clubs help. Hobby-related activities help. \n\nRight before COVID lockdowns here in LA, I made a friend with my tattoo artist, barely knew him otherwise. He mentioned he and his friends were gonna start watching crappy 80's horror movies on the weekend. I was down. Then the lockdowns hit, and we couldn't do it. And I'm bad at making friends with new people I've barely met, so I've made no attempts to reconnect. Maybe when I get back to the tattoo shop. Goes back to point #1.\n\nMaking friends will be hard. But if you're lucky, and make enough connections, it won't be *as hard*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#5. \"Expect the best, prepare for the worst.\"\n\nHaving a positive outlook is healthy. If you're perpetually despondent, hopeless, and listless, you probably have depression, and that needs tending to. But ONLY having a positive outlook will lead you to trouble. You must prepare for the times when life throws a wrench into your car tire. Saving money is necessary. Blowing it all and wondering how you're gonna eat next week is pointless drama you've placed upon yourself. Get a checking account, a savings account, and a retirement account. Even if you only put $10 / week into the thing, AND LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE, you'll likely have a nice rainy day fund when the shit hits the fan. \n\nLiving in a fire-prone region? make sure you have proper equipment in case wildfires become too dangerous. Earthquake kits, first aid kits, bottled water, blankets, etc. \n\nIf you don't live in a place with reliable mass transit, best make sure you have a car that's in good working order. In that car, ensure you have a fresh spare tire (replace tires every 5 years, unless otherwise indicated by professionals). Know how to change a tire: loosen those lugnuts FIRST, then jack up the car, remove tire, replace tire, tighten lug nuts with wrench, lower the car SLOWLY AND SAFELY, finish tightening lugnuts, etc. Know how to bleed brakes (get a friend to help). Replace wipers and fluid before the rainy season as needed. SO much car care is necessary, going back to point #1.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#6. Kissing ass and networking are IMPORTANT.\n\nIf you think you're going to have a *remotely* successful life, you're going to be kissing a LOT of ass. It doesn't mean completely shoving your nose up someone's ass, but sometimes it might. If you are regularly on someone's radar in a good way, especially someone with an inkling of power, you're going to be one of the first people they think of for a promotion or raise or relocation to an exotic land. You're going to have to wear a lot of \"masks\" when you're around various people. Or you could just become like me and avoid that, keep your \"self respect\", and be poor and ignored. \n\nI was \"discovered\" last year. Like, legit. I was on a podcast with a coworker (I was the interviewee), and **an executive producer of one of the nation's largest morning shows** heard the podcast. He found me a month later, talked to me, and helped me get started. He gave me a lot of advice that I never used (regarding kissing ass, etc.), because I'm a fuck up. After a month, he dropped me, told me I needed to \"be my own cheerleader\". Coulda been a host on the radio in Los Angeles, but I'm not.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#7. Hard Work & Luck.\n\nLuck starts your journey, hard work continues it. Anyone successful who doesn't say they are lucky (or outright refuses to acknowledge it) are not people to look up to. [Survivorship Bias](https://xkcd.com/1827/) is a huge factor. If you look at all the people who've worked hard and were successful, and then found everyone else who did similar, but aren't successful, you can factor in luck for the successful. Every. Single. Time. This [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&vl) better explains everything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#8. \"No man is an island.\"\n\nYou can't do this alone. Everyone who gets anywhere in life is doing it with the help of others. They could be supportive parents. Friends who love them for who they are. Teachers that see the possibilities. Employers who see growth. Coworkers that empower their workday. Baristas at the coffee shop with a smile. Strangers on the train who hold the door for 1 extra second (don't go nuts on this one, people, there's a threshold). If you are surrounded by supportive and loving people, life, in all its difficulties and flaws and foibles, will become much less work. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#9. Life is a game.\n\nIf you don't play, you lose. If you don't play by the rules, you lose. If you don't play well with others, you lose. No matter how much you want it or not, you're in the game. You have no choice. And your only opponent is you. Goes back to #6, and ties in with #8. And despite how shitty the game is, again, if you choose not to play, you will reap zero rewards. You might get a ball to the face, too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#10. Iroh\n\n[\"While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZZXAvHySQ4)\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\n#I have failed at all 10 of these points.
