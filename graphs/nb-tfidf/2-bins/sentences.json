I began volunteering at the school to help in class to give me more time with our kids. She called to tell me that she had made the executive decision that I couldn't do that anymore. I told her she had no right to make that decision. She pulled out the education decision making card, and I told her that gave her no right to tell me what to do on my own time.

My coworker brought a lot of experience and skills to the table so many executives and bosses want him working on their projects in their departments in their umbrella of the company. When it was time for him to ask for a raise, our manager, director, and executive director turned him down and low balled him with a counter offer so insultingly low he started looking for jobs outside of the company.\n\nCFO, and other senior VPs heard about said move and reached out to him to get him to stay, and they worked it out amongst each other so they can share him in their special projects along with a hefty compensation package.\n\nCoworker being respectful puts in a request to transfer that has to be approved by the current manager, director, and executive director which they promptly turned down. To make matters worse, they go ahead and write him up for \"attendance\" problems from a couple of months ago... We're all salary, and for the most part project based.\n\nThroughout all of this, I am a fly on the wall since we shared an office, here I am laughing with him while he was in phone calls with the literal people who ran the company. He was told to ignore all that, they apologized to him, they got VP of Human Relations in on the meeting explained the situation which then launched an internal investigation unbeknownst to the 3 clowns.\n\nthe ensuing shit storm that came down onto the 3 clowns is more than enough to make this story awesome, but the cherry on top, is that he is now their boss...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr: \"management\" team tries to screw over an employee who ends up being their boss.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE**: thank you for the award, and as a thank you, I will share the rest of the tea, sorry for the delay. \n\nthe way it would've worked before all this went down, is that, said executive director was gonna be promoted into a VP position and move into the big player's lounge in our main office, director which is clown#2 would've taken EXECdir spot, and clown#3 which was manager would've taken director job. \n\nThe powers that may be, CFO, senior VPs that were working behind the scenes took this opportunity to let the clowns dig a hole for themselves.  and to everybody's delight, they did. \n\nI'm going to start with the matter at hand, CFO and senior VPs told my coworker to sit tight, and they will make sure that he is taken care of, and that he from then on will be only taking instructions from them, with the VP of HR on the phone, the process of re-routing him up the chain of command went super fast. I mean why wouldn't it, the bosses who would've reviewed and approved all this have been working behind the scenes to make it happen and they are all on the phone now. My coworker was told that by the next business day he just had to fill in the proper paperwork and to send it straight to VP of HR, and formal announcements will be made to the rest of the company by the end of the week. My coworker then asked the bosses to use some of his newly granted compensation for a vacation week, just to avoid the drama.  \n\nTHIS WEEK was glorious. The clowns were busy calling my coworker, blowing up his phone. LOVING the drama that was going on, I was texting him updates. Since clown #1,2, and 3 always relied on us salaried grunts to take care of everything for them, their incompetence kept showing in their \"BIG\" projects. Projects that have to be submitted to the same CFO and senior VPs that caused all this for them. Every one of our internal clients (other departments, execs, and bosses within the company) was looking for my coworker, the incompetency of the clowns have spread across at the management level, they are all now bypassing them and going straight to us to get things done. \n\nHR was prompted by the VP of HR to start investigations in the background and we were all interviewed and sworn to secrecy. \n\nThe end of the week comes, and my coworker comes in, brand new suit, sits on his desk, and we start our usual banter.  This is supposed to be the day of the big announcement. Clown #3 calls my coworker into the office to write him up for as many things as clown #3 can. \\*\\*\\*\\*THIS I CANNOT CONFIRM because I'm only hearing this from my coworker\\*\\*\\*\\* but apparently clown#3 was putting the book down on him, and threatened termination due to the number of offenses (they wouldn't have fired him, they needed him that much)\n\nMy coworker has a habit of giving a deadpan face and just shrugging through everything that is not interesting to him, so apparently that's what he did. \n\nWhat I can confirm is that after this meeting, he showed me an email of said clown#3 scheduling a meeting with him and clown #2, and #1. WHICHHHH HE DECLINES IN FRONT OF ME...he laughs, looks at me, says watch this,  he walks out, and after some time comes back into the building with the Senior VP straight to clown#1's office Exec Dir.\n\nsome time passes and it was fun to watch Clown #2 Director, and Clown #3 Manager rush to the same office. \n\nThey were all passed over for the promotions, were not granted their raises, and now all their projects go to my coworker for approval. \n\nI no longer work for the company, after some more drama I have moved on as well. I'm still in touch with my coworker, the last update I have heard is that clown #1 and #2 exec director and director would be retiring this year after so long with the company. \n\nI heard that #3 burnt the team to the ground due to sheer incompetence, and is on the way out as well. #3 started the team with a total of 9 direct reports now down to 2.",

So not only was it hot out and we\u2019re all in tuxes serving a shit-ton of people, the family of the bride who are funding this affair are some of the rudest and most-demanding people imaginable, so it was not the most fun gig in general. \n\nWell, one of the aunts on the bride\u2019s turned out to be the rudest of the bunch and kept trying to pull the \u201cI\u2019m related to the bride so give me give me give me\u201d-act (even though she wasn\u2019t even in the fucking wedding party), and was just making the lives of any one of us who came in contact with her even more of a living hell than what we were experiencing, including the owner of the company, who was lead bartender at the main bar. \n\nNow that point is key because, by some grace of whatever higher power/force/fate/kismet or whatever you call it, I was also working that same bar, which gave me the opportunity to bear witness to the most beautifully constructed instance of comeuppance to which I had ever seen to that point, and don\u2019t expect to ever see it bettered again: the nightmare bitch aunt is in young bossman\u2019s bar line, and loudly complaining the whole time how long it\u2019s taking, and she shouldn\u2019t even have to be waiting in a line anyway because she\u2019s whatever-the-bride\u2019s name\u2019s aunt, blah-blah-blah, just making a huge stink.

I want to talk to your manager or the owner or someone who\u2019s an adult who can get you out of here and get the job done right.\u201d To which a huge shit-ass-eating grin washed over his face as he replied, \u201cHi! My name (his name). I am the owner of this catering company, please note that if you would like for me to go, then this reception will have no food or beverages or bar service.\u201d \n\nI swear you could almost hear a hype crew descending from the heavens shouting \u201cOHHHHHHH!!!\u201d after he said it. It was a moment of transcendence I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever experience again. Plus, the bitchy aunt didn\u2019t bother us again the rest of the night.\n\n*edited to include paragraphs*",

My (Canadian) family and friends all came over because most had never been.

It was around 10 C, in Early November.  When you mix in wool suits, drinking, and lots of dancing, some of us Colonists were working up a bit of a sweat.    Thankfully, the venue had a balcony, with huge doors.    \n\n\nI kept going over and opening them, as some folks were inside, some were outside, and there was a nice breeze... but... I had to keep going over, because they were shut whenever I looked back.  \n\n\nFinally, after the 5th or 6th time, this guy followed me, and demanded I keep the doors shut because it was cold inside.  I didn't know who he was, so he must have been a +1 of someone on my wife's side, so I was mighty confused when he said, and I quote \"Who the hell do you think you are keeping these doors open, and the temperature so low inside.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I'm the guy who bought you dinner.\"  \n\n\nI watched him go over to my now cousin-in-law and grab his coat and almost pull her out the front door.  \n\n\nI thought one of my Groomsmen was going to burst he laughed so hard.",

It might be satisfying to get shit off your chest and tell people off as you're leaving a gig or a job, but it's a really small world. Really. You will be shocked at how connected everyone is these days and who talks to who. \n* Be kind.\n* Read Dale Carnegie's book How to Win Friends and Influence People. There are some audio book versions on youtube you can listen to. Some of the examples are out of date (like letters and calling cards...) but the sentiment is not. It is single handedly the keys to success in interpersonal relationships at work, school, or in your love life. \n* Listen more than you talk, and don't just wait for your time to talk in a conversation.   \n\n\n**Self Help / Self Improvement**\n\n* Always improve.\n* Read a book. \n* Keep a journal occasionally. It's good for reflection on how far you've come.   \n\n\n**Sex**\n\n* Is awesome.\n* babies are forever. Use protection if you\u2019re not ready for them. I love mine, but I am 30 - you might not want a baby until later if you even want one at all. \n* Don't put it on a pedestal. If it's the only reason you're into someone, chances are that relationship isnt going to last.\n* STDs are mostly permeant, just wear a condom or make your partner wear one...\n* People have sex, don't shame people for the number of partners they have had (or haven't?). In fact, nothing good comes out of even asking someone you're interested in the question of how many women they've slept with.    \n\n\n**Cars**\n\n* you don't need the greatest car in the world. \n* don't waste your money on a new car.  1 owner trade in if you're looking for new fancy tech. 7 year, 70k mile, $7k price tag is about the car you should be chasing. \n* learn how the car works\n* dont be afraid to get a second estimate for car repairs\n* car insurance is stupid expensive, and the \"it drops at 25\" is a myth. \n* don't let people borrow your car. you're liable for whatever happens. \n* don't cheap out on tires or brakes. if you have tire/ brake problems with your car, get them fixed.  \n\n\n**Drugs / Alcohol**\n\n* if you do drugs, don't make it your life. pot is not a lifestyle, it's a drug. nobody likes \"that guy\" who doesn't shut up about drugs. same goes for booze / liquor.\n* some shit will seriously ruin your body, just be careful \n* learn your limits and stay within them while drinking. nobody likes a drunk. \n* dont get behind the wheel of a car after drinking - this WILL ruin your life. have a plan. a $200 dollar taxi trip is wayyy cheaper than bail + legal fees for DUI/DWI.  \n\n\n**Job Satisfaction**\n\n* don't stay in a job you hate. \n* find something you can enjoy. it sounds silly but it helps to find something positive about your line of work. if you can't, work towards a new career. \n* value yourself and your time. dont let work walk all over you.   \n\n\n**Clothes**\n\n* wash them, learn to do laundry regardless of what gender you are\n* dont worry about brands. buy brands because they are quality, and last - don't buy clothes that have excessive rips and tears (oh god i sound old... i promise they were super cool to me when I was a teen) clothes get really expensive\n* buy something dressy, but not too flashy. Button down with a tie, matching slacks, a belt, and some dress socks/shoes. make sure it fits. if you can afford it, get something dark/neutral colored for attending funerals, and something pleasant for attending weddings. These clothes don't have to be really expensive.   \n\n\n**Mental Health / Fitness**\n\n* check in on your friends. vent to professionals, not to your friends.\n* smile often, it helps. \n* life is awesome, it gets better, and this too shall pass. time really does heal all wounds, it may be miserable now but it will get better. \n* Go for a walk every now and then. Go to the gym if you want to. You don't need to be a gym rat to be in decent shape.\n* Abs are made in the kitchen, not on the ab roller or crunch machine.

All elements of your life, be they self-care, friendships, relationships, work-life balance, health, your house, your car, bank accounts, etc. require **constant** repair. This is our attempt at slowing down entropy. We'll never stop it, as the [energy of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2iTCm0xpDc) is constantly trying to seek perfect equilibrium, and our efforts only last a lifetime. If you wish to be even *remotely* successful in life, you will recognize how much work you will need to put into every little thing. Otherwise, you'll end up like me: alone, unloved, unhealthy, and ready to die at a moment's notice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#2. \"Know thyself.\"\n\nIf you don't know who you are, you're gonna have a bad time. You need to understand that your life is HEAVILY impacted by various forms of luck: where you live; how much money your family has; how abusive your family is; the school system's resources; the literal air that you are breathing. These all have an impact on your life, and the possibility of your future life. The opportunities or obstacles of your life are LARGELY dictated by simple factors of luck. Not all, but I'll get to that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#3. \"Be yourself\"...is horseshit.\n\nIf you don't know who you are, *how the hell can you be yourself\u203d* How do you overcome this catch-22? \n\nA better variant, IMO, is ***\"be the person you wish to become\"***. Not a living or dead person that you hope to magically morph into. But the person that you, in your mind, wish to be in the future. \n\nDo you want to [be kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sicUhD1n-es), or ruthless? Do you want to be respected, or feared? To you want to help, or hurt? Those are broad and vague, and there are many many more, but they're starting points for how to approach your future. If you've decided to be ruthless, then you'll begin to adapt behaviors that go that route. If you're a meek and timid person who can't even say their name clearly (been there, done that, relevant username now), you're not likely to command any kind of respect.\n\nIf who you are right now is not what you want to be, then \"being yourself\" is the worst advice you'll receive. You must change yourself, because whether you like it or not, change occurs, and you can't control the majority of those changes. So change the ones you *can*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#4. Friends come and go.\n\nThe reason you have friends *right now* is because of geographic (and, to a not-to-be-dismissed degree, socioeconomic) reasons. Once you stop going to the same schools, and movie theaters, and book stores, and restaurants, etc. the friendships will begin to diminish. You will more likely grow apart over time, not together. It's possible, sure. But don't make any heavy bets, because you'll lose money on those bets more often than not.\n\nYou'll need to find new ways of making friends. College is yet another school-related location that can help. Clubs help. Hobby-related activities help. \n\nRight before COVID lockdowns here in LA, I made a friend with my tattoo artist, barely knew him otherwise. He mentioned he and his friends were gonna start watching crappy 80's horror movies on the weekend. I was down. Then the lockdowns hit, and we couldn't do it. And I'm bad at making friends with new people I've barely met, so I've made no attempts to reconnect. Maybe when I get back to the tattoo shop. Goes back to point #1.\n\nMaking friends will be hard. But if you're lucky, and make enough connections, it won't be *as hard*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#5. \"Expect the best, prepare for the worst.\"\n\nHaving a positive outlook is healthy. If you're perpetually despondent, hopeless, and listless, you probably have depression, and that needs tending to. But ONLY having a positive outlook will lead you to trouble. You must prepare for the times when life throws a wrench into your car tire. Saving money is necessary. Blowing it all and wondering how you're gonna eat next week is pointless drama you've placed upon yourself. Get a checking account, a savings account, and a retirement account. Even if you only put $10 / week into the thing, AND LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE, you'll likely have a nice rainy day fund when the shit hits the fan. \n\nLiving in a fire-prone region? make sure you have proper equipment in case wildfires become too dangerous. Earthquake kits, first aid kits, bottled water, blankets, etc. \n\nIf you don't live in a place with reliable mass transit, best make sure you have a car that's in good working order. In that car, ensure you have a fresh spare tire (replace tires every 5 years, unless otherwise indicated by professionals). Know how to change a tire: loosen those lugnuts FIRST, then jack up the car, remove tire, replace tire, tighten lug nuts with wrench, lower the car SLOWLY AND SAFELY, finish tightening lugnuts, etc. Know how to bleed brakes (get a friend to help). Replace wipers and fluid before the rainy season as needed. SO much car care is necessary, going back to point #1.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#6. Kissing ass and networking are IMPORTANT.\n\nIf you think you're going to have a *remotely* successful life, you're going to be kissing a LOT of ass. It doesn't mean completely shoving your nose up someone's ass, but sometimes it might. If you are regularly on someone's radar in a good way, especially someone with an inkling of power, you're going to be one of the first people they think of for a promotion or raise or relocation to an exotic land. You're going to have to wear a lot of \"masks\" when you're around various people. Or you could just become like me and avoid that, keep your \"self respect\", and be poor and ignored. \n\nI was \"discovered\" last year. Like, legit. I was on a podcast with a coworker (I was the interviewee), and **an executive producer of one of the nation's largest morning shows** heard the podcast. He found me a month later, talked to me, and helped me get started. He gave me a lot of advice that I never used (regarding kissing ass, etc.), because I'm a fuck up. After a month, he dropped me, told me I needed to \"be my own cheerleader\". Coulda been a host on the radio in Los Angeles, but I'm not.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#7. Hard Work & Luck.\n\nLuck starts your journey, hard work continues it. Anyone successful who doesn't say they are lucky (or outright refuses to acknowledge it) are not people to look up to. [Survivorship Bias](https://xkcd.com/1827/) is a huge factor. If you look at all the people who've worked hard and were successful, and then found everyone else who did similar, but aren't successful, you can factor in luck for the successful. Every. Single. Time. This [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&vl) better explains everything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#8. \"No man is an island.\"\n\nYou can't do this alone. Everyone who gets anywhere in life is doing it with the help of others. They could be supportive parents. Friends who love them for who they are. Teachers that see the possibilities. Employers who see growth. Coworkers that empower their workday. Baristas at the coffee shop with a smile. Strangers on the train who hold the door for 1 extra second (don't go nuts on this one, people, there's a threshold). If you are surrounded by supportive and loving people, life, in all its difficulties and flaws and foibles, will become much less work. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#9. Life is a game.\n\nIf you don't play, you lose. If you don't play by the rules, you lose. If you don't play well with others, you lose. No matter how much you want it or not, you're in the game. You have no choice. And your only opponent is you. Goes back to #6, and ties in with #8. And despite how shitty the game is, again, if you choose not to play, you will reap zero rewards. You might get a ball to the face, too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#10. Iroh\n\n[\"While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZZXAvHySQ4)\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\n#I have failed at all 10 of these points. Don't be like me.\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\ntl;dr - read it anyway. I just gave you multiple summaries of life. I'm not summarizing my summaries, dammit! Now go out there, try to have fun, and try to find some meaning.",
