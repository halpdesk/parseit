I stopped to take a drink of water and she marched up to me going \"WE DON'T PAY YOU TO STAND AROUND DRINKING YOU KNOW!\" to which I calmly responded that I was thirsty, and needed a drink of water, and if she wanted to tell me I wasn't allowed to have a glass of water then good luck, but I'm pretty sure health and safety would have something to say about that. She huffed about not having had a break all day, which I ignored cos not my fucking problem, but internally I was put out about it, because it was totally fucking pointless to be such a twat about things.\n\nAbout 2 weeks in I get promoted to Supervisor as I was clearly extremely competent by their usual standards (I could walk and fart at the same time) but she also gets promoted to Floor Manager, so she continues to work her little power trips and try and lord it over me (and everyone else)\n\n4 weeks after that, I get another promotion to Floor Manager, and at this point we're equals, so she can't boss me around anymore. So instead, she tries a different tack, which is to try and lord it over me with her superior knowledge of processes, where to find stuff etc.\n\nMy response is to go (saccharine sweet) \"Oh thanks!

I tell the owner that we need to move at least the big things, so if we only have 3 hours we will make it work the best we can (then rent another truck elsewhere during the week) but he keeps chewing up more time arguing then says the kicker. He will look up the call recording to see who is right. I have absolute trust in my father when he says he did something, so I agree and wait.\n\nTurns out the owner was the one that took the call and he gets smug. \"I have done this for 20 some years and I don't make mistakes.\" Five minutes later, sounding defeated, he is asking us to bring it back early so we don't mess up another person's move (guilting us for his mistake that he never makes).

So not only was it hot out and we\u2019re all in tuxes serving a shit-ton of people, the family of the bride who are funding this affair are some of the rudest and most-demanding people imaginable, so it was not the most fun gig in general. \n\nWell, one of the aunts on the bride\u2019s turned out to be the rudest of the bunch and kept trying to pull the \u201cI\u2019m related to the bride so give me give me give me\u201d-act (even though she wasn\u2019t even in the fucking wedding party), and was just making the lives of any one of us who came in contact with her even more of a living hell than what we were experiencing, including the owner of the company, who was lead bartender at the main bar. \n\nNow that point is key because, by some grace of whatever higher power/force/fate/kismet or whatever you call it, I was also working that same bar, which gave me the opportunity to bear witness to the most beautifully constructed instance of comeuppance to which I had ever seen to that point, and don\u2019t expect to ever see it bettered again: the nightmare bitch aunt is in young bossman\u2019s bar line, and loudly complaining the whole time how long it\u2019s taking, and she shouldn\u2019t even have to be waiting in a line anyway because she\u2019s whatever-the-bride\u2019s name\u2019s aunt, blah-blah-blah, just making a huge stink. When she got up to the head of the line to place her order, she said something along the lines of how slow and ineffectual he was, to which he responded something along the lines of \u201cwe\u2019re going as the fast as we can, here\u2019s your drink, have a nice evening\u201d (through gritted teeth I\u2019m sure), which led her into the following diatribe: \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re nothing but a bunch of dumbass kids - don\u2019t you have any adults back there working this wedding? I want to talk to your manager or the owner or someone who\u2019s an adult who can get you out of here and get the job done right.\u201d To which a huge shit-ass-eating grin washed over his face as he replied, \u201cHi! My name (his name). I am the owner of this catering company, please note that if you would like for me to go, then this reception will have no food or beverages or bar service.\u201d \n\nI swear you could almost hear a hype crew descending from the heavens shouting \u201cOHHHHHHH!!!\u201d after he said it. It was a moment of transcendence I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever experience again. Plus, the bitchy aunt didn\u2019t bother us again the rest of the night.\n\n*edited to include paragraphs*",

Remember at one point your widgets were the greatest, don't try and keep up with your neighbors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Relationships**\n\n* Don't burn bridges, no matter how obscure they are. It might be satisfying to get shit off your chest and tell people off as you're leaving a gig or a job, but it's a really small world. Really. You will be shocked at how connected everyone is these days and who talks to who. \n* Be kind.\n* Read Dale Carnegie's book How to Win Friends and Influence People. There are some audio book versions on youtube you can listen to. Some of the examples are out of date (like letters and calling cards...) but the sentiment is not. It is single handedly the keys to success in interpersonal relationships at work, school, or in your love life. \n* Listen more than you talk, and don't just wait for your time to talk in a conversation.   \n\n\n**Self Help / Self Improvement**\n\n* Always improve.\n* Read a book. \n* Keep a journal occasionally. It's good for reflection on how far you've come.   \n\n\n**Sex**\n\n* Is awesome.\n* babies are forever. Use protection if you\u2019re not ready for them. I love mine, but I am 30 - you might not want a baby until later if you even want one at all. \n* Don't put it on a pedestal. If it's the only reason you're into someone, chances are that relationship isnt going to last.\n* STDs are mostly permeant, just wear a condom or make your partner wear one...\n* People have sex, don't shame people for the number of partners they have had (or haven't?). In fact, nothing good comes out of even asking someone you're interested in the question of how many women they've slept with.    \n\n\n**Cars**\n\n* you don't need the greatest car in the world. \n* don't waste your money on a new car.  1 owner trade in if you're looking for new fancy tech. 7 year, 70k mile, $7k price tag is about the car you should be chasing. \n* learn how the car works\n* dont be afraid to get a second estimate for car repairs\n* car insurance is stupid expensive, and the \"it drops at 25\" is a myth. \n* don't let people borrow your car. you're liable for whatever happens. \n* don't cheap out on tires or brakes. if you have tire/ brake problems with your car, get them fixed.  \n\n\n**Drugs / Alcohol**\n\n* if you do drugs, don't make it your life. pot is not a lifestyle, it's a drug. nobody likes \"that guy\" who doesn't shut up about drugs. same goes for booze / liquor.\n* some shit will seriously ruin your body, just be careful \n* learn your limits and stay within them while drinking. nobody likes a drunk. \n* dont get behind the wheel of a car after drinking - this WILL ruin your life. have a plan. a $200 dollar taxi trip is wayyy cheaper than bail + legal fees for DUI/DWI.  \n\n\n**Job Satisfaction**\n\n* don't stay in a job you hate. \n* find something you can enjoy. it sounds silly but it helps to find something positive about your line of work. if you can't, work towards a new career. \n* value yourself and your time. dont let work walk all over you.   \n\n\n**Clothes**\n\n* wash them, learn to do laundry regardless of what gender you are\n* dont worry about brands. buy brands because they are quality, and last - don't buy clothes that have excessive rips and tears (oh god i sound old... i promise they were super cool to me when I was a teen) clothes get really expensive\n* buy something dressy, but not too flashy. Button down with a tie, matching slacks, a belt, and some dress socks/shoes. make sure it fits. if you can afford it, get something dark/neutral colored for attending funerals, and something pleasant for attending weddings. These clothes don't have to be really expensive.   \n\n\n**Mental Health / Fitness**\n\n* check in on your friends. vent to professionals, not to your friends.\n* smile often, it helps. \n* life is awesome, it gets better, and this too shall pass. time really does heal all wounds, it may be miserable now but it will get better. \n* Go for a walk every now and then. Go to the gym if you want to. You don't need to be a gym rat to be in decent shape.\n* Abs are made in the kitchen, not on the ab roller or crunch machine. Don't eat like shit, because you can't out train a bad diet.",

                "sent": "Well, this might be a long one.\n\nI grew up around a mother with dissociative disorder as well as narcissism. She was addicted to opiates as far back as I can remember, and would do anything to get them, and I mean anything.\n\nGrowing up, it wasn't rare for her to have a tantrum during one of her highs and beat the shit out of me, break me down by picking apart every little thing she knew I was afraid or self-conscious of, and actively sabotage my relationship with my father and siblings.\n\nShe would be up for days at a time, pass out standing up with her eyes glassed over and back hunched, and when she festered once again start moving and otherwise destroying everything in the house.\n\nThere were times where I'd leave and the house would be clean, and come home and it would look as though a pissed off tornado had run through the house i.e. broken glass, animal feces, dirty clothes, roaches, empty pill bottles, ground-up pill residue, and other miscellaneous things littering the house. On particularly bad nights she would hallucinate, and during those times it wouldn't be uncommon to find pools of her blood on the ground from running through glass.\n\nI remember being up for days at a time because her and my father would scream at each other for days at a time without stopping; actively trying to get me to pick one side or the other even if it meant barging into my room at 4 am to begin their screaming match where I could watch.\n\nShe manipulated me, abandoned me at times in the middle of nowhere when she'd meet up with her various sugar daddies (she was still with my dad during this), and never once apologized during her brief moments of mental clarity. If anything, she would blame everything but herself. In her mind she was infallible.\n\nMoney was always a big issue since she couldn't work in such a state. She sold some of her pills, yes, but ultimately those funds were used to buy more drugs anyway. Because of this, we were homeless frequently, without power and water for literally years at a time, and barely ever had any food. It was almost every night I went to sleep with the only thing I'd have eaten that day being a school lunch. On weekends, sometimes I didn't eat at all.\n\nThe rest of my family had no clue this was happening. During the summer when I was 16, my aunt whom I hadn't talked much with since I was a lot younger got in touch. She asked if I'd like to come to stay with them in Texas for a few weeks during the summer.\n\nOf course I said yes, and I was absolutely ecstatic. I didn't bother asking my parents since I'd be very much surprised if they even noticed I was gone so they were unaware. My aunt drove up all the way to Iowa and stayed the afternoon with us.\n\nMy parents seemed to lack the cognition to recognize she was even there out of the blue so they didn't come out of their room. As I stated before would happen frequently, when she arrived our house was fairly clean. We left for a bit to go get food, and when we returned the tornado had already passed.\n\nAs she told me when we were on our way to Texas: the thing that bothered her the most wasn't that our house had suddenly gone to hell, it was that I didn't even react to it. Instead, I tiptoed around the debris and started packing my things without a word.\n\nThis deeply unsettled her, and ultimately she asked me if I was safe where I lived. I said yes, as it was all I had ever known. She told me that what she saw frightened her, and she wanted me to come live with her in Texas. Thinking that she was joking, I brushed it off. After a few days down there though, I knew I had to do it. They showed me love, compassion, and care that I'd never even known existed prior to this and it shook me to my core.\n\nSo we decided, I was going to get emancipated from my parents and move in with them. Ultimately, this involved sitting in a courthouse across from my parents and their lawyer.\n\nThe judge asked why I wanted to leave, and I explained the above. I expressed the love and compassion I'd experienced for the first time in my life, and that I wanted to, for once, live in peace.\n\nTheir lawyer rebutted, \"To me, it seems as though you have no respect for your parents. Is it because of their financial situation? It looks as though you're attached to the perks of living in a family that makes a reasonable amount of money, and not that you want to leave because they're unfit parents.\"\n\nMy mother and father joined in, hooting and hollering actively trying to break me down as they have so many times before.\n\nI let him speak, I let them speak, and I held my tongue until it was my turn. They tried to goad me on, tried to break me as they had so many times before, but I wouldn't let them.\n\nFinally, the judge asked me to speak.\n\nWith as level a stare as I could muster, I looked at mother, my father, and their lawyer across from me and said \"If you're asking me if I have no respect for my parents, then you are correct. However, to say it's simply financially motivated is incorrect. I no longer have respect for them because they have-\"\n\nAs I was nearly finished, my mother, as she had so many times in the past began to squirm and scream at me from across the table. \"HE'S LYING THE LITTLE BASTARD IS JUS-\"\n\nUntil the Judge slammed his gavel down and cut the room; my mother staring up at him in complete and utter disbelief.\n\nI looked at her, keeping the tears I knew were right behind the corner at bay and said, \"For once in your life; for once in my life, behave as an adult. You can't stop me by simply yelling over me anymore, you have nothing to hold over me now. You can do nothing.\"\n\nAs I spoke, the judge motioned to his officer who moved towards my mother. Her expression still frozen in complete bewilderment as the officer aggressively told her to get up out of her chair and escorted her out of the room.\n\nThe judge looked to me, my aunt, my father, and his lawyer with one sweeping glance and then spoke.\n\n\"I am sorry that you have had to deal with this for so long young man. There's nothing more that you or anyone else needs to say. You deserve to live a normal life as a normal kid and it's obvious to me now that your parents are unfit to produce that kind of environment. You will go back to Texas with your Aunt, and we will regularly have our social workers in touch to check in on how you are doing. Make the most of this second chance, good luck young man. Adjourned.\"\n\nThough the bang of his gavel was the only noise that permeated the room, all I could hear was the ringing in my ears. My father and his lawyer were escorted out of the room and the tears I had held back all this time came gushing out like a tidal wave.\n\nIt's been 7 years since that day and I am happy to say that I've managed to grow up and become a well-adjusted adult. I have a great career, great friends, and an amazing girlfriend. I've been in therapy ever since we got back to Texas, and I no longer have trouble sleeping or terrible bouts of anxiety and depression as I used to.\n\nLife is good.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nMother is a narcissist with dissociative personality disorder addicted to opiates. Father kind of just went with the flow and didn't really do much. Aunt came down to take me to Texas, saw how shit everything was and asked me if I wanted to live with them. After some time I said yes, went to court against my parents under the pretense of emancipation, and got to stare them down and layout all the trauma, pain, and fear they've caused me. My mother was escorted out of the room when she tried to cut over me, and the judge sided with us and I was emancipated. Now I'm doing really well.",

My (Canadian) family and friends all came over because most had never been.

It was around 10 C, in Early November.  When you mix in wool suits, drinking, and lots of dancing, some of us Colonists were working up a bit of a sweat.    Thankfully, the venue had a balcony, with huge doors.    \n\n\nI kept going over and opening them, as some folks were inside, some were outside, and there was a nice breeze... but... I had to keep going over, because they were shut whenever I looked back.  \n\n\nFinally, after the 5th or 6th time, this guy followed me, and demanded I keep the doors shut because it was cold inside.  I didn't know who he was, so he must have been a +1 of someone on my wife's side, so I was mighty confused when he said, and I quote \"Who the hell do you think you are keeping these doors open, and the temperature so low inside.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I'm the guy who bought you dinner.\"  \n\n\nI watched him go over to my now cousin-in-law and grab his coat and almost pull her out the front door.  \n\n\nI thought one of my Groomsmen was going to burst he laughed so hard.",

We had one plane that had an issue on takeoff and veered off the runway, it cartwheeled and totaled the airplane but fortunately the pilot was not serious injured.  I had a student who was next in line for takeoff when it happened, he called me from his phone as it happened.  I hopped in the airport car with one of the rampers and drove out to the plane with a radio to inform inbound planes to use the other runway (we had no control tower).  On the way to the runway I called the airport manager who drove to the airport and on his way he made a phone call to officially closed that runway.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later a metric fuckton of DPS officers showed up and immediately tried to close the whole airport, treating it like a giant crime scene.  They were carelessley driving around the airport like they owned the place, ignoring the planes that were moving around, and crossing our only open runway without regard to inbound traffic.  A mechanic and I tried to tell them to be careful and they got mad at us.  One of them told me they were \"locking it down\" a couple times, meaning the whole airport.  Now I was a broke ass flight instructor and I had a flight that afternoon that was ultimately going to help pay for me to eat that week.\n\nThe airport manager was a short stereotypical country guy, also former Navy.  He was not intimidated at all by the cops trying to close his airport.  When he showed up I was about to go out with a student who was preflighting for a cross-country.  There were about 5 cops in the lobby, me with my flight bag, the airport manager, and a mechanic.  One of the cops saw my flight bag and said \"I don't know why you have that or why he's out a the plane, you aren't going anywhere\", the moment he finished his sentence the airport manager said \"it's one runway that's closed, the airport is still open.  This pissed off the cops.\n\nI was about to head out the door, and one of the officers said he was driving out to the disabled plane.  Idky, the pilot had been gone for about an hour.  The mechanic said \"you need to be careful\" and the cop quickly retorted \"AND WHY THE HELL IS THAT?\" and he said \"because this is still an airport, and the first thing that hits you is going to be a propeller\" a few seconds later a plane took off as one of the cars was approaching the runway intersection ironing in that point.\n\nI walked out, and as I was hopping in the plane with my student the same cop came up to me and said \"you aren't going anywhere, we're locking this down!\"  I looked at the airport manager who followed all of us out to the ramp, he said \"have a nice flight AjaxBU!\" \n\nYou could see these cops just fuming that they didn't have the authority to close down an entire airport because one plane went off the runway.   The airport had two runways, where the disabled plane was located was probably a mile or so away from the open runway.  Why they were making a big fuss, I don't know.  The occupant was relatively uninjured, his wife was the worst thing he had to deal with that day, he told her he wasn't going to fly.\n\nWe had a good flight, and I got to eat dinner that week.",

My coworker brought a lot of experience and skills to the table so many executives and bosses want him working on their projects in their departments in their umbrella of the company. When it was time for him to ask for a raise, our manager, director, and executive director turned him down and low balled him with a counter offer so insultingly low he started looking for jobs outside of the company.\n\nCFO, and other senior VPs heard about said move and reached out to him to get him to stay, and they worked it out amongst each other so they can share him in their special projects along with a hefty compensation package.\n\nCoworker being respectful puts in a request to transfer that has to be approved by the current manager, director, and executive director which they promptly turned down. To make matters worse, they go ahead and write him up for \"attendance\" problems from a couple of months ago... We're all salary, and for the most part project based.\n\nThroughout all of this, I am a fly on the wall since we shared an office, here I am laughing with him while he was in phone calls with the literal people who ran the company. He was told to ignore all that, they apologized to him, they got VP of Human Relations in on the meeting explained the situation which then launched an internal investigation unbeknownst to the 3 clowns.\n\nthe ensuing shit storm that came down onto the 3 clowns is more than enough to make this story awesome, but the cherry on top, is that he is now their boss...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr: \"management\" team tries to screw over an employee who ends up being their boss.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE**: thank you for the award, and as a thank you, I will share the rest of the tea, sorry for the delay. \n\nthe way it would've worked before all this went down, is that, said executive director was gonna be promoted into a VP position and move into the big player's lounge in our main office, director which is clown#2 would've taken EXECdir spot, and clown#3 which was manager would've taken director job. \n\nThe powers that may be, CFO, senior VPs that were working behind the scenes took this opportunity to let the clowns dig a hole for themselves.  and to everybody's delight, they did. \n\nI'm going to start with the matter at hand, CFO and senior VPs told my coworker to sit tight, and they will make sure that he is taken care of, and that he from then on will be only taking instructions from them, with the VP of HR on the phone, the process of re-routing him up the chain of command went super fast. I mean why wouldn't it, the bosses who would've reviewed and approved all this have been working behind the scenes to make it happen and they are all on the phone now. My coworker was told that by the next business day he just had to fill in the proper paperwork and to send it straight to VP of HR, and formal announcements will be made to the rest of the company by the end of the week. My coworker then asked the bosses to use some of his newly granted compensation for a vacation week, just to avoid the drama.  \n\nTHIS WEEK was glorious. The clowns were busy calling my coworker, blowing up his phone. LOVING the drama that was going on, I was texting him updates. Since clown #1,2, and 3 always relied on us salaried grunts to take care of everything for them, their incompetence kept showing in their \"BIG\" projects. Projects that have to be submitted to the same CFO and senior VPs that caused all this for them. Every one of our internal clients (other departments, execs, and bosses within the company) was looking for my coworker, the incompetency of the clowns have spread across at the management level, they are all now bypassing them and going straight to us to get things done. \n\nHR was prompted by the VP of HR to start investigations in the background and we were all interviewed and sworn to secrecy. \n\nThe end of the week comes, and my coworker comes in, brand new suit, sits on his desk, and we start our usual banter.  This is supposed to be the day of the big announcement. Clown #3 calls my coworker into the office to write him up for as many things as clown #3 can. \\*\\*\\*\\*THIS I CANNOT CONFIRM because I'm only hearing this from my coworker\\*\\*\\*\\* but apparently clown#3 was putting the book down on him, and threatened termination due to the number of offenses (they wouldn't have fired him, they needed him that much)\n\nMy coworker has a habit of giving a deadpan face and just shrugging through everything that is not interesting to him, so apparently that's what he did. \n\nWhat I can confirm is that after this meeting, he showed me an email of said clown#3 scheduling a meeting with him and clown #2, and #1. WHICHHHH HE DECLINES IN FRONT OF ME...he laughs, looks at me, says watch this,  he walks out, and after some time comes back into the building with the Senior VP straight to clown#1's office Exec Dir.\n\nsome time passes and it was fun to watch Clown #2 Director, and Clown #3 Manager rush to the same office. \n\nThey were all passed over for the promotions, were not granted their raises, and now all their projects go to my coworker for approval. \n\nI no longer work for the company, after some more drama I have moved on as well. I'm still in touch with my coworker, the last update I have heard is that clown #1 and #2 exec director and director would be retiring this year after so long with the company. \n\nI heard that #3 burnt the team to the ground due to sheer incompetence, and is on the way out as well. #3 started the team with a total of 9 direct reports now down to 2.",

All elements of your life, be they self-care, friendships, relationships, work-life balance, health, your house, your car, bank accounts, etc. require **constant** repair. This is our attempt at slowing down entropy. We'll never stop it, as the [energy of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2iTCm0xpDc) is constantly trying to seek perfect equilibrium, and our efforts only last a lifetime. If you wish to be even *remotely* successful in life, you will recognize how much work you will need to put into every little thing. Otherwise, you'll end up like me: alone, unloved, unhealthy, and ready to die at a moment's notice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#2. \"Know thyself.\"\n\nIf you don't know who you are, you're gonna have a bad time. You need to understand that your life is HEAVILY impacted by various forms of luck: where you live; how much money your family has; how abusive your family is; the school system's resources; the literal air that you are breathing. These all have an impact on your life, and the possibility of your future life. The opportunities or obstacles of your life are LARGELY dictated by simple factors of luck. Not all, but I'll get to that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#3. \"Be yourself\"...is horseshit.\n\nIf you don't know who you are, *how the hell can you be yourself\u203d* How do you overcome this catch-22? \n\nA better variant, IMO, is ***\"be the person you wish to become\"***. Not a living or dead person that you hope to magically morph into. But the person that you, in your mind, wish to be in the future. \n\nDo you want to [be kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sicUhD1n-es), or ruthless? Do you want to be respected, or feared? To you want to help, or hurt? Those are broad and vague, and there are many many more, but they're starting points for how to approach your future. If you've decided to be ruthless, then you'll begin to adapt behaviors that go that route. If you're a meek and timid person who can't even say their name clearly (been there, done that, relevant username now), you're not likely to command any kind of respect.\n\nIf who you are right now is not what you want to be, then \"being yourself\" is the worst advice you'll receive. You must change yourself, because whether you like it or not, change occurs, and you can't control the majority of those changes. So change the ones you *can*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#4. Friends come and go.\n\nThe reason you have friends *right now* is because of geographic (and, to a not-to-be-dismissed degree, socioeconomic) reasons. Once you stop going to the same schools, and movie theaters, and book stores, and restaurants, etc. the friendships will begin to diminish. You will more likely grow apart over time, not together. It's possible, sure. But don't make any heavy bets, because you'll lose money on those bets more often than not.\n\nYou'll need to find new ways of making friends. College is yet another school-related location that can help. Clubs help. Hobby-related activities help. \n\nRight before COVID lockdowns here in LA, I made a friend with my tattoo artist, barely knew him otherwise. He mentioned he and his friends were gonna start watching crappy 80's horror movies on the weekend. I was down. Then the lockdowns hit, and we couldn't do it. And I'm bad at making friends with new people I've barely met, so I've made no attempts to reconnect. Maybe when I get back to the tattoo shop. Goes back to point #1.\n\nMaking friends will be hard. But if you're lucky, and make enough connections, it won't be *as hard*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#5. \"Expect the best, prepare for the worst.\"\n\nHaving a positive outlook is healthy. If you're perpetually despondent, hopeless, and listless, you probably have depression, and that needs tending to. But ONLY having a positive outlook will lead you to trouble. You must prepare for the times when life throws a wrench into your car tire. Saving money is necessary. Blowing it all and wondering how you're gonna eat next week is pointless drama you've placed upon yourself. Get a checking account, a savings account, and a retirement account. Even if you only put $10 / week into the thing, AND LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE, you'll likely have a nice rainy day fund when the shit hits the fan. \n\nLiving in a fire-prone region? make sure you have proper equipment in case wildfires become too dangerous. Earthquake kits, first aid kits, bottled water, blankets, etc. \n\nIf you don't live in a place with reliable mass transit, best make sure you have a car that's in good working order. In that car, ensure you have a fresh spare tire (replace tires every 5 years, unless otherwise indicated by professionals). Know how to change a tire: loosen those lugnuts FIRST, then jack up the car, remove tire, replace tire, tighten lug nuts with wrench, lower the car SLOWLY AND SAFELY, finish tightening lugnuts, etc. Know how to bleed brakes (get a friend to help). Replace wipers and fluid before the rainy season as needed. SO much car care is necessary, going back to point #1.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#6. Kissing ass and networking are IMPORTANT.\n\nIf you think you're going to have a *remotely* successful life, you're going to be kissing a LOT of ass. It doesn't mean completely shoving your nose up someone's ass, but sometimes it might. If you are regularly on someone's radar in a good way, especially someone with an inkling of power, you're going to be one of the first people they think of for a promotion or raise or relocation to an exotic land. You're going to have to wear a lot of \"masks\" when you're around various people. Or you could just become like me and avoid that, keep your \"self respect\", and be poor and ignored. \n\nI was \"discovered\" last year. Like, legit. I was on a podcast with a coworker (I was the interviewee), and **an executive producer of one of the nation's largest morning shows** heard the podcast. He found me a month later, talked to me, and helped me get started. He gave me a lot of advice that I never used (regarding kissing ass, etc.), because I'm a fuck up. After a month, he dropped me, told me I needed to \"be my own cheerleader\". Coulda been a host on the radio in Los Angeles, but I'm not.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#7. Hard Work & Luck.\n\nLuck starts your journey, hard work continues it. Anyone successful who doesn't say they are lucky (or outright refuses to acknowledge it) are not people to look up to. [Survivorship Bias](https://xkcd.com/1827/) is a huge factor. If you look at all the people who've worked hard and were successful, and then found everyone else who did similar, but aren't successful, you can factor in luck for the successful. Every. Single. Time. This [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&vl) better explains everything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#8. \"No man is an island.\"\n\nYou can't do this alone. Everyone who gets anywhere in life is doing it with the help of others. They could be supportive parents. Friends who love them for who they are. Teachers that see the possibilities. Employers who see growth. Coworkers that empower their workday. Baristas at the coffee shop with a smile. Strangers on the train who hold the door for 1 extra second (don't go nuts on this one, people, there's a threshold). If you are surrounded by supportive and loving people, life, in all its difficulties and flaws and foibles, will become much less work. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#9. Life is a game.\n\nIf you don't play, you lose. If you don't play by the rules, you lose. If you don't play well with others, you lose. No matter how much you want it or not, you're in the game. You have no choice. And your only opponent is you. Goes back to #6, and ties in with #8. And despite how shitty the game is, again, if you choose not to play, you will reap zero rewards. You might get a ball to the face, too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#10. Iroh\n\n[\"While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZZXAvHySQ4)\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\n#I have failed at all 10 of these points. Don't be like me.\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\ntl;dr - read it anyway. I just gave you multiple summaries of life. I'm not summarizing my summaries, dammit!
