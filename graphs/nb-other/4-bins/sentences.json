I was dirty as hell from my previous job and swung by the store to pick him up and take him to one of our sites where he would be doing paperwork. The moment he got in the truck, he immediately started talking shit. He started telling me about how everything we were doing is fucked up and the department manager <my name> was a total moron and he would have my job within a few months.\n\nI just sat and mostly listened. He obviously didn't know shit about my industry and every time he would say something wrong, I would try to politely correct him and he'd either backtrack or insist that I was trained wrong. When we got to the site OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEST TEXAS DESERT, he complained about the layer of dust on everything and \"ordered me\" to clean up the entire site.\n\nWhen I sat down at my desk, the guy continued to bitch my ear off about everything that was wrong and chastised me for sitting down at my desk when he told me to clean up the site. So I called for a taxi, filled out a notice of termination, and handed it to him. He looked absolutely shocked. Then he defiantly protested that only <CEO> could fire him. I said and <my name>, right? He sheepishly nodded. So I stuck my hand out for a handshake and introduced myself.\n\nI can teach anyone how to service equipment, but I don't have a clue how to teach someone to not be an asshole.",

The L.A.P.D. was so convinced that they had their man that they tried to make the evidence fit the suspect rather than allowing the evidence to lead them to a suspect. \n\nO.J. didn't do it: \n\nNicole Brown was nearly decapitated and Ron Goldman was stabbed 20+ times. The prosecution claimed the injuries were consistent with two knives being used and produced a stiletto knife -good for stabbing but not cutting- and a Swiss Army knife -not really good for hurting anyone other than yourself. Ron Goldman had numerous defensive wounds and the injuries to his hands indicated that he had landed numerous blows yet O.J. had only a small cut on his hand with no other evidence of having been in a fight. The only evidence found in O.J.'s home were a few drops of his own blood which were contaminated with a preservative used in blood draws.\n\nJason did it: \n\nMeans: Jason was employed as a sous-chef and had his own knife set and also owned a double-edged combat knife.\n\nMotive: Jason was cooking alone at his restaurant that night and had specifically invited Nicole to come see him cook. She stood him up and went to Mezzaluna where Ron Goldman worked. Jason was known to be bothered by Nicole seeing men other than his father.\n\nOpportunity: Jason's timecard that night was handwritten for a time much later than when the restaurant shut down. His alibi changed multiple times, but the last time anyone can definitely account for him is around 9:30 that night.\n\nThe kicker? The day after the murders, O.J. retained one of L.A.'s top criminal defense attorneys for Jason and did not hire his own defense attorney until several days later.",

As I was trying to squeeze by everyone after stopping downstairs, some guy towards the top of the staircase intentionally stepped in my way and refused to move. After asking him to politely move twice, he made a comment under his breath (but purposefully loud enough so I heard it) that I should essentially go screw myself and that lawyers are entitled assholes and should wait in line like everyone else (which they actually do). He didn\u2019t move so I said sorry and quietly waited behind him for a few minutes. \n\n20 minutes later, I call him out of the courtroom to plea bargain and got the satisfaction of seeing his face when he realized I was the prosecutor",

                "sent": "I found out my parents wanted to send me to a different secondary school from all my friends, for several reasons that made sense to them, but little lonely me who didn't have many friends was not happy AT ALL to be losing those I had. And then, I found out that not only would I have to start all over again, but this school had lessons...on SATURDAYS.\n\nWell, fuck that. I hated school at that age, weekends were my refuge, and now I was even losing some of  that? Nope. I cried, I begged, pleaded...but their minds were set.\n\nAnd then...and then someone let slip that this school had an entrance exam. It wasn't difficult, I was pretty sure I could pass it, but my parents clearly assumed it was a given, clearly having forgotten that I had free will, or assuming that I was so used to doing what I was told that I'd just do it.\n\nWRONG.\n\nIn my very first act of childhood rebellion (aged 11), I went and told them that if they made me do it, I would fail the entrance exam on purpose.\n\nYou could see that it had not even occurred to them that this could happen. I still remember the moment of pure, unadulterated surprised Pikachu face before the sputtering, shouting, threatening (not violence, just grounding, loss of privileges etc) began. My favourite exchange involved my Mum telling me that I WOULD pass that exam and me responding, \"No I won't. You can't MAKE me,\" and rendering her, for one of the first times in our relationship, speechless.\n\nThe whole thing was as revelatory for them, especially my Mum, as it was for me. I learned to stand up for myself, and that I had free will, and they learned that I wasn't some obedient little girl who would participate without question and was not just always going to meekly fall in line. \n\nThe change of school thing was dropped. I didn't really even get punished too much, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong and my parents (who may have come off sounding terrible but were in fact wonderful, just unaware of the stubbornness they'd gifted their daughter) felt uneasy about teaching me that exercising free will was wrong, particularly as my mum was a teacher. I wasn't allowed a riding lesson that week, and that was it. \n\nFunnily enough, I now think I probably would have been better off changing schools. The reason I didn't have many friends was that I was bullied at school - quiet, academic, wore THE MOST ridiculous glasses (adult-sized, on a 7yo's face, because my sight was so shit that they didn't make lenses the strength I needed in child sizes in the 80s \ud83d\ude44) - so a new start in a new school where no one knew me would have been an opportunity to start over. But the fact that I'd been bullied made that seem like a horror instead of a good thing and I didn't have many friends but those friendships were hard won and close because we were all the outcasts for various reasons (kids SUCK). That school (despite the Saturday lessons) catered for more of my interests and favourite subjects too.\n\nThing is, if my parents had sat me down and talked to me about it, pointing out the positives of a new start and that the school had a curriculum that I'd love, and reassuring me they probably could have talked me into it. The mistake they made was simply trying to steamroller me and ignore my feelings and thoughts. So there's a parenting tip for you.\n\nIf this story ever comes up, my parents deny it, or say I'm misremembering or embellishing it, but I'm honestly not. It was such a moment of revelation to me, such a formative experience that it's imprinted on my memory, the day I learned that I had free will even if it contradicted my parents.",
