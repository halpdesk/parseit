We had one plane that had an issue on takeoff and veered off the runway, it cartwheeled and totaled the airplane but fortunately the pilot was not serious injured.  I had a student who was next in line for takeoff when it happened, he called me from his phone as it happened.  I hopped in the airport car with one of the rampers and drove out to the plane with a radio to inform inbound planes to use the other runway (we had no control tower).  On the way to the runway I called the airport manager who drove to the airport and on his way he made a phone call to officially closed that runway.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later a metric fuckton of DPS officers showed up and immediately tried to close the whole airport, treating it like a giant crime scene.  They were carelessley driving around the airport like they owned the place, ignoring the planes that were moving around, and crossing our only open runway without regard to inbound traffic.  A mechanic and I tried to tell them to be careful and they got mad at us.  One of them told me they were \"locking it down\" a couple times, meaning the whole airport.  Now I was a broke ass flight instructor and I had a flight that afternoon that was ultimately going to help pay for me to eat that week.\n\nThe airport manager was a short stereotypical country guy, also former Navy.  He was not intimidated at all by the cops trying to close his airport.  When he showed up I was about to go out with a student who was preflighting for a cross-country.  There were about 5 cops in the lobby, me with my flight bag, the airport manager, and a mechanic.  One of the cops saw my flight bag and said \"I don't know why you have that or why he's out a the plane, you aren't going anywhere\", the moment he finished his sentence the airport manager said \"it's one runway that's closed, the airport is still open.  This pissed off the cops.\n\nI was about to head out the door, and one of the officers said he was driving out to the disabled plane.  Idky, the pilot had been gone for about an hour.  The mechanic said \"you need to be careful\" and the cop quickly retorted \"AND WHY THE HELL IS THAT?\" and he said \"because this is still an airport, and the first thing that hits you is going to be a propeller\" a few seconds later a plane took off as one of the cars was approaching the runway intersection ironing in that point.\n\nI walked out, and as I was hopping in the plane with my student the same cop came up to me and said \"you aren't going anywhere, we're locking this down!\"  I looked at the airport manager who followed all of us out to the ramp, he said \"have a nice flight AjaxBU!\" \n\nYou could see these cops just fuming that they didn't have the authority to close down an entire airport because one plane went off the runway.   The airport had two runways, where the disabled plane was located was probably a mile or so away from the open runway.  Why they were making a big fuss, I don't know.  The occupant was relatively uninjured, his wife was the worst thing he had to deal with that day, he told her he wasn't going to fly.\n\nWe had a good flight, and I got to eat dinner that week.",

I tell the fellow behind the desk that this should be for 24 hours, and he says it is not in the system and it is spoken for already after we return it for another rental. I ask if there is anything we can do at which time the owner comes over to see what the issue is.\n\nI explain it to him and he proceeds to chastise me, saying we must not have ordered it correctly, if we need it so long why are we 35 minutes late, and a bunch of other down talk. By this time my father comes in to see why I have not come out, and also gets talked down to which upsets me internally. I tell the owner that we need to move at least the big things, so if we only have 3 hours we will make it work the best we can (then rent another truck elsewhere during the week) but he keeps chewing up more time arguing then says the kicker. He will look up the call recording to see who is right. I have absolute trust in my father when he says he did something, so I agree and wait.\n\nTurns out the owner was the one that took the call and he gets smug. \"I have done this for 20 some years and I don't make mistakes.\" Five minutes later, sounding defeated, he is asking us to bring it back early so we don't mess up another person's move (guilting us for his mistake that he never makes). On the call you clearly hear my father asking for the 24 hour rental with multiple confirmations from the owner throughout the call. Guy was a real jerk, never even apologized for anything.

Remember at one point your widgets were the greatest, don't try and keep up with your neighbors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Relationships**\n\n* Don't burn bridges, no matter how obscure they are. It might be satisfying to get shit off your chest and tell people off as you're leaving a gig or a job, but it's a really small world. Really. You will be shocked at how connected everyone is these days and who talks to who. \n* Be kind.\n* Read Dale Carnegie's book How to Win Friends and Influence People. There are some audio book versions on youtube you can listen to. Some of the examples are out of date (like letters and calling cards...) but the sentiment is not. It is single handedly the keys to success in interpersonal relationships at work, school, or in your love life. \n* Listen more than you talk, and don't just wait for your time to talk in a conversation.   \n\n\n**Self Help / Self Improvement**\n\n* Always improve.\n* Read a book. \n* Keep a journal occasionally. It's good for reflection on how far you've come.   \n\n\n**Sex**\n\n* Is awesome.\n* babies are forever. Use protection if you\u2019re not ready for them. I love mine, but I am 30 - you might not want a baby until later if you even want one at all. \n* Don't put it on a pedestal. If it's the only reason you're into someone, chances are that relationship isnt going to last.\n* STDs are mostly permeant, just wear a condom or make your partner wear one...\n* People have sex, don't shame people for the number of partners they have had (or haven't?). In fact, nothing good comes out of even asking someone you're interested in the question of how many women they've slept with.    \n\n\n**Cars**\n\n* you don't need the greatest car in the world. \n* don't waste your money on a new car.  1 owner trade in if you're looking for new fancy tech. 7 year, 70k mile, $7k price tag is about the car you should be chasing. \n* learn how the car works\n* dont be afraid to get a second estimate for car repairs\n* car insurance is stupid expensive, and the \"it drops at 25\" is a myth. \n* don't let people borrow your car. you're liable for whatever happens. \n* don't cheap out on tires or brakes. if you have tire/ brake problems with your car, get them fixed.  \n\n\n**Drugs / Alcohol**\n\n* if you do drugs, don't make it your life. pot is not a lifestyle, it's a drug. nobody likes \"that guy\" who doesn't shut up about drugs. same goes for booze / liquor.\n* some shit will seriously ruin your body, just be careful \n* learn your limits and stay within them while drinking. nobody likes a drunk. \n* dont get behind the wheel of a car after drinking - this WILL ruin your life. have a plan. a $200 dollar taxi trip is wayyy cheaper than bail + legal fees for DUI/DWI.  \n\n\n**Job Satisfaction**\n\n* don't stay in a job you hate. \n* find something you can enjoy. it sounds silly but it helps to find something positive about your line of work. if you can't, work towards a new career. \n* value yourself and your time. dont let work walk all over you.   \n\n\n**Clothes**\n\n* wash them, learn to do laundry regardless of what gender you are\n* dont worry about brands. buy brands because they are quality, and last - don't buy clothes that have excessive rips and tears (oh god i sound old... i promise they were super cool to me when I was a teen) clothes get really expensive\n* buy something dressy, but not too flashy. Button down with a tie, matching slacks, a belt, and some dress socks/shoes. make sure it fits. if you can afford it, get something dark/neutral colored for attending funerals, and something pleasant for attending weddings. These clothes don't have to be really expensive.   \n\n\n**Mental Health / Fitness**\n\n* check in on your friends. vent to professionals, not to your friends.\n* smile often, it helps. \n* life is awesome, it gets better, and this too shall pass. time really does heal all wounds, it may be miserable now but it will get better. \n* Go for a walk every now and then. Go to the gym if you want to. You don't need to be a gym rat to be in decent shape.\n* Abs are made in the kitchen, not on the ab roller or crunch machine. Don't eat like shit, because you can't out train a bad diet.",

                "sent": "I'm 39.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#1. Life is work. \n\nEverything requires perpetual maintenance. All elements of your life, be they self-care, friendships, relationships, work-life balance, health, your house, your car, bank accounts, etc. require **constant** repair. This is our attempt at slowing down entropy. We'll never stop it, as the [energy of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2iTCm0xpDc) is constantly trying to seek perfect equilibrium, and our efforts only last a lifetime. If you wish to be even *remotely* successful in life, you will recognize how much work you will need to put into every little thing. Otherwise, you'll end up like me: alone, unloved, unhealthy, and ready to die at a moment's notice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#2. \"Know thyself.\"\n\nIf you don't know who you are, you're gonna have a bad time. You need to understand that your life is HEAVILY impacted by various forms of luck: where you live; how much money your family has; how abusive your family is; the school system's resources; the literal air that you are breathing. These all have an impact on your life, and the possibility of your future life. The opportunities or obstacles of your life are LARGELY dictated by simple factors of luck. Not all, but I'll get to that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#3. \"Be yourself\"...is horseshit.\n\nIf you don't know who you are, *how the hell can you be yourself\u203d* How do you overcome this catch-22? \n\nA better variant, IMO, is ***\"be the person you wish to become\"***. Not a living or dead person that you hope to magically morph into. But the person that you, in your mind, wish to be in the future. \n\nDo you want to [be kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sicUhD1n-es), or ruthless? Do you want to be respected, or feared? To you want to help, or hurt? Those are broad and vague, and there are many many more, but they're starting points for how to approach your future. If you've decided to be ruthless, then you'll begin to adapt behaviors that go that route. If you're a meek and timid person who can't even say their name clearly (been there, done that, relevant username now), you're not likely to command any kind of respect.\n\nIf who you are right now is not what you want to be, then \"being yourself\" is the worst advice you'll receive. You must change yourself, because whether you like it or not, change occurs, and you can't control the majority of those changes. So change the ones you *can*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#4. Friends come and go.\n\nThe reason you have friends *right now* is because of geographic (and, to a not-to-be-dismissed degree, socioeconomic) reasons. Once you stop going to the same schools, and movie theaters, and book stores, and restaurants, etc. the friendships will begin to diminish. You will more likely grow apart over time, not together. It's possible, sure. But don't make any heavy bets, because you'll lose money on those bets more often than not.\n\nYou'll need to find new ways of making friends. College is yet another school-related location that can help. Clubs help. Hobby-related activities help. \n\nRight before COVID lockdowns here in LA, I made a friend with my tattoo artist, barely knew him otherwise. He mentioned he and his friends were gonna start watching crappy 80's horror movies on the weekend. I was down. Then the lockdowns hit, and we couldn't do it. And I'm bad at making friends with new people I've barely met, so I've made no attempts to reconnect. Maybe when I get back to the tattoo shop. Goes back to point #1.\n\nMaking friends will be hard. But if you're lucky, and make enough connections, it won't be *as hard*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#5. \"Expect the best, prepare for the worst.\"\n\nHaving a positive outlook is healthy. If you're perpetually despondent, hopeless, and listless, you probably have depression, and that needs tending to. But ONLY having a positive outlook will lead you to trouble. You must prepare for the times when life throws a wrench into your car tire. Saving money is necessary. Blowing it all and wondering how you're gonna eat next week is pointless drama you've placed upon yourself. Get a checking account, a savings account, and a retirement account. Even if you only put $10 / week into the thing, AND LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE, you'll likely have a nice rainy day fund when the shit hits the fan. \n\nLiving in a fire-prone region? make sure you have proper equipment in case wildfires become too dangerous. Earthquake kits, first aid kits, bottled water, blankets, etc. \n\nIf you don't live in a place with reliable mass transit, best make sure you have a car that's in good working order. In that car, ensure you have a fresh spare tire (replace tires every 5 years, unless otherwise indicated by professionals). Know how to change a tire: loosen those lugnuts FIRST, then jack up the car, remove tire, replace tire, tighten lug nuts with wrench, lower the car SLOWLY AND SAFELY, finish tightening lugnuts, etc. Know how to bleed brakes (get a friend to help). Replace wipers and fluid before the rainy season as needed. SO much car care is necessary, going back to point #1.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#6. Kissing ass and networking are IMPORTANT.\n\nIf you think you're going to have a *remotely* successful life, you're going to be kissing a LOT of ass. It doesn't mean completely shoving your nose up someone's ass, but sometimes it might. If you are regularly on someone's radar in a good way, especially someone with an inkling of power, you're going to be one of the first people they think of for a promotion or raise or relocation to an exotic land. You're going to have to wear a lot of \"masks\" when you're around various people. Or you could just become like me and avoid that, keep your \"self respect\", and be poor and ignored. \n\nI was \"discovered\" last year. Like, legit. I was on a podcast with a coworker (I was the interviewee), and **an executive producer of one of the nation's largest morning shows** heard the podcast. He found me a month later, talked to me, and helped me get started. He gave me a lot of advice that I never used (regarding kissing ass, etc.), because I'm a fuck up. After a month, he dropped me, told me I needed to \"be my own cheerleader\". Coulda been a host on the radio in Los Angeles, but I'm not.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#7. Hard Work & Luck.\n\nLuck starts your journey, hard work continues it. Anyone successful who doesn't say they are lucky (or outright refuses to acknowledge it) are not people to look up to. [Survivorship Bias](https://xkcd.com/1827/) is a huge factor. If you look at all the people who've worked hard and were successful, and then found everyone else who did similar, but aren't successful, you can factor in luck for the successful. Every. Single. Time. This [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&vl) better explains everything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#8. \"No man is an island.\"\n\nYou can't do this alone. Everyone who gets anywhere in life is doing it with the help of others. They could be supportive parents. Friends who love them for who they are. Teachers that see the possibilities. Employers who see growth. Coworkers that empower their workday. Baristas at the coffee shop with a smile. Strangers on the train who hold the door for 1 extra second (don't go nuts on this one, people, there's a threshold). If you are surrounded by supportive and loving people, life, in all its difficulties and flaws and foibles, will become much less work. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#9. Life is a game.\n\nIf you don't play, you lose. If you don't play by the rules, you lose. If you don't play well with others, you lose. No matter how much you want it or not, you're in the game. You have no choice. And your only opponent is you. Goes back to #6, and ties in with #8. And despite how shitty the game is, again, if you choose not to play, you will reap zero rewards. You might get a ball to the face, too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#10. Iroh\n\n[\"While it is always best to believe in oneself, a little help from others can be a great blessing.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZZXAvHySQ4)\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\n#I have failed at all 10 of these points. Don't be like me.\n\n&nbsp;\n___\n\ntl;dr - read it anyway. I just gave you multiple summaries of life. I'm not summarizing my summaries, dammit! Now go out there, try to have fun, and try to find some meaning.",

So he\u2019s standing outside the elevator thinking of what to do and he gets an Idea. Running into a nearby office, he asks a coworker if he can use their desk phone for a second... and proceeds to call his own phone. He does this a few times.\n\nA couple minutes later, someone else hysterically phones security, saying that there\u2019s a cat stuck in the elevator shaft. A few other people in the elevator at the time corroborate the story, so the elevator maintenance folk run the elevator up the shaft and shine some light down there. \n\nMeanwhile, my dad and some other people are standing by the open doors to the shaft, looking downwards. \nMy dad says, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t see any cat...but I think I see my phone down there! Can you guys grab it for me?\u201d \nAnd they do.",
