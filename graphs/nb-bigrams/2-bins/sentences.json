I stopped to take a drink of water and she marched up to me going \"WE DON'T PAY YOU TO STAND AROUND DRINKING YOU KNOW!\" to which I calmly responded that I was thirsty, and needed a drink of water, and if she wanted to tell me I wasn't allowed to have a glass of water then good luck, but I'm pretty sure health and safety would have something to say about that. She huffed about not having had a break all day, which I ignored cos not my fucking problem, but internally I was put out about it, because it was totally fucking pointless to be such a twat about things.\n\nAbout 2 weeks in I get promoted to Supervisor as I was clearly extremely competent by their usual standards (I could walk and fart at the same time) but she also gets promoted to Floor Manager, so she continues to work her little power trips and try and lord it over me (and everyone else)\n\n4 weeks after that, I get another promotion to Floor Manager, and at this point we're equals, so she can't boss me around anymore. So instead, she tries a different tack, which is to try and lord it over me with her superior knowledge of processes, where to find stuff etc.\n\nMy response is to go (saccharine sweet) \"Oh thanks!

It was around 10 C, in Early November.  When you mix in wool suits, drinking, and lots of dancing, some of us Colonists were working up a bit of a sweat.    Thankfully, the venue had a balcony, with huge doors.    \n\n\nI kept going over and opening them, as some folks were inside, some were outside, and there was a nice breeze... but... I had to keep going over, because they were shut whenever I looked back.  \n\n\nFinally, after the 5th or 6th time, this guy followed me, and demanded I keep the doors shut because it was cold inside.  I didn't know who he was, so he must have been a +1 of someone on my wife's side, so I was mighty confused when he said, and I quote \"Who the hell do you think you are keeping these doors open, and the temperature so low inside.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I'm the guy who bought you dinner.\"  \n\n\nI watched him go over to my now cousin-in-law and grab his coat and almost pull her out the front door.  \n\n\nI thought one of my Groomsmen was going to burst he laughed so hard.",

Nothing major, just a process change in how we checked in patients arriving by EMS. This policy worked at her facility but we weren't equipped to implement it.

We had one plane that had an issue on takeoff and veered off the runway, it cartwheeled and totaled the airplane but fortunately the pilot was not serious injured.  I had a student who was next in line for takeoff when it happened, he called me from his phone as it happened.  I hopped in the airport car with one of the rampers and drove out to the plane with a radio to inform inbound planes to use the other runway (we had no control tower).  On the way to the runway I called the airport manager who drove to the airport and on his way he made a phone call to officially closed that runway.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later a metric fuckton of DPS officers showed up and immediately tried to close the whole airport, treating it like a giant crime scene.  They were carelessley driving around the airport like they owned the place, ignoring the planes that were moving around, and crossing our only open runway without regard to inbound traffic.  A mechanic and I tried to tell them to be careful and they got mad at us.  One of them told me they were \"locking it down\" a couple times, meaning the whole airport.  Now I was a broke ass flight instructor and I had a flight that afternoon that was ultimately going to help pay for me to eat that week.\n\nThe airport manager was a short stereotypical country guy, also former Navy.  He was not intimidated at all by the cops trying to close his airport.  When he showed up I was about to go out with a student who was preflighting for a cross-country.  There were about 5 cops in the lobby, me with my flight bag, the airport manager, and a mechanic.  One of the cops saw my flight bag and said \"I don't know why you have that or why he's out a the plane, you aren't going anywhere\", the moment he finished his sentence the airport manager said \"it's one runway that's closed, the airport is still open.  This pissed off the cops.\n\nI was about to head out the door, and one of the officers said he was driving out to the disabled plane.  Idky, the pilot had been gone for about an hour.  The mechanic said \"you need to be careful\" and the cop quickly retorted \"AND WHY THE HELL IS THAT?\" and he said \"because this is still an airport, and the first thing that hits you is going to be a propeller\" a few seconds later a plane took off as one of the cars was approaching the runway intersection ironing in that point.\n\nI walked out, and as I was hopping in the plane with my student the same cop came up to me and said \"you aren't going anywhere, we're locking this down!\"  I looked at the airport manager who followed all of us out to the ramp, he said \"have a nice flight AjaxBU!\" \n\nYou could see these cops just fuming that they didn't have the authority to close down an entire airport because one plane went off the runway.   The airport had two runways, where the disabled plane was located was probably a mile or so away from the open runway.  Why they were making a big fuss, I don't know.  The occupant was relatively uninjured, his wife was the worst thing he had to deal with that day, he told her he wasn't going to fly.\n\nWe had a good flight, and I got to eat dinner that week.",
