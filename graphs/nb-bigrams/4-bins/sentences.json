I stopped to take a drink of water and she marched up to me going \"WE DON'T PAY YOU TO STAND AROUND DRINKING YOU KNOW!\" to which I calmly responded that I was thirsty, and needed a drink of water, and if she wanted to tell me I wasn't allowed to have a glass of water then good luck, but I'm pretty sure health and safety would have something to say about that. She huffed about not having had a break all day, which I ignored cos not my fucking problem, but internally I was put out about it, because it was totally fucking pointless to be such a twat about things.\n\nAbout 2 weeks in I get promoted to Supervisor as I was clearly extremely competent by their usual standards (I could walk and fart at the same time) but she also gets promoted to Floor Manager, so she continues to work her little power trips and try and lord it over me (and everyone else)\n\n4 weeks after that, I get another promotion to Floor Manager, and at this point we're equals, so she can't boss me around anymore. So instead, she tries a different tack, which is to try and lord it over me with her superior knowledge of processes, where to find stuff etc.\n\nMy response is to go (saccharine sweet) \"Oh thanks! That's so helpful, I mean you know how things work so much better than me, because you've been here 5 years, and I've only been here 6 weeks...\"\n\nShe had a face like a smacked arse.

As in, half my damn shift. I told him that the store manager had instructed me never to leave the technology department, but he insisted. This went on for several weeks.\n\nThe store manager showed up one weekend when both the power trippin shift manager and I were working. The store manager walks up with the shift manager close behind.

This is our average technology sales numbers for the weeks you are on shift. See this number over here? This is our average technology sales numbers for weeks you are not. At this point, it would be more cost effective for me to simply fire you. What do you think of that solution?\"\n\nThe guy stammers and stutters like a toddler caught bullying another kid on the playground. Fortunately, the dude wasn't fired, but the store manager made it clear that when I was on shift, I was not to leave the technology department unless I was on break or there was a fire in the store.

I explain to him that because he had it cut to a specific length, if we were to take it back, there would be a restock fee (because we're not going to be able to resell it until someone needs that exact specific length).

You can do class online. But the university sees these discussions, and know they\u2019ll lose A LOT of money if they don\u2019t have students in residence. \n\nSo what is announced? Almost EVERY first year has at least 1 person class. Meaning? They have to be on campus. MEANING, they have to live in residence. \n\nIdk if this makes sense to anyone but I thought it was interesting.",
