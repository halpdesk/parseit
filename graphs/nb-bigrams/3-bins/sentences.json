                "sent": "Well, this might be a long one.\n\nI grew up around a mother with dissociative disorder as well as narcissism. She was addicted to opiates as far back as I can remember, and would do anything to get them, and I mean anything.\n\nGrowing up, it wasn't rare for her to have a tantrum during one of her highs and beat the shit out of me, break me down by picking apart every little thing she knew I was afraid or self-conscious of, and actively sabotage my relationship with my father and siblings.\n\nShe would be up for days at a time, pass out standing up with her eyes glassed over and back hunched, and when she festered once again start moving and otherwise destroying everything in the house.\n\nThere were times where I'd leave and the house would be clean, and come home and it would look as though a pissed off tornado had run through the house i.e. broken glass, animal feces, dirty clothes, roaches, empty pill bottles, ground-up pill residue, and other miscellaneous things littering the house. On particularly bad nights she would hallucinate, and during those times it wouldn't be uncommon to find pools of her blood on the ground from running through glass.\n\nI remember being up for days at a time because her and my father would scream at each other for days at a time without stopping; actively trying to get me to pick one side or the other even if it meant barging into my room at 4 am to begin their screaming match where I could watch.\n\nShe manipulated me, abandoned me at times in the middle of nowhere when she'd meet up with her various sugar daddies (she was still with my dad during this), and never once apologized during her brief moments of mental clarity. If anything, she would blame everything but herself. In her mind she was infallible.\n\nMoney was always a big issue since she couldn't work in such a state. She sold some of her pills, yes, but ultimately those funds were used to buy more drugs anyway. Because of this, we were homeless frequently, without power and water for literally years at a time, and barely ever had any food. It was almost every night I went to sleep with the only thing I'd have eaten that day being a school lunch. On weekends, sometimes I didn't eat at all.\n\nThe rest of my family had no clue this was happening. During the summer when I was 16, my aunt whom I hadn't talked much with since I was a lot younger got in touch. She asked if I'd like to come to stay with them in Texas for a few weeks during the summer.\n\nOf course I said yes, and I was absolutely ecstatic. I didn't bother asking my parents since I'd be very much surprised if they even noticed I was gone so they were unaware. My aunt drove up all the way to Iowa and stayed the afternoon with us.\n\nMy parents seemed to lack the cognition to recognize she was even there out of the blue so they didn't come out of their room. As I stated before would happen frequently, when she arrived our house was fairly clean. We left for a bit to go get food, and when we returned the tornado had already passed.\n\nAs she told me when we were on our way to Texas: the thing that bothered her the most wasn't that our house had suddenly gone to hell, it was that I didn't even react to it. Instead, I tiptoed around the debris and started packing my things without a word.\n\nThis deeply unsettled her, and ultimately she asked me if I was safe where I lived. I said yes, as it was all I had ever known. She told me that what she saw frightened her, and she wanted me to come live with her in Texas. Thinking that she was joking, I brushed it off. After a few days down there though, I knew I had to do it. They showed me love, compassion, and care that I'd never even known existed prior to this and it shook me to my core.\n\nSo we decided, I was going to get emancipated from my parents and move in with them. Ultimately, this involved sitting in a courthouse across from my parents and their lawyer.\n\nThe judge asked why I wanted to leave, and I explained the above. I expressed the love and compassion I'd experienced for the first time in my life, and that I wanted to, for once, live in peace.\n\nTheir lawyer rebutted, \"To me, it seems as though you have no respect for your parents. Is it because of their financial situation? It looks as though you're attached to the perks of living in a family that makes a reasonable amount of money, and not that you want to leave because they're unfit parents.\"\n\nMy mother and father joined in, hooting and hollering actively trying to break me down as they have so many times before.\n\nI let him speak, I let them speak, and I held my tongue until it was my turn. They tried to goad me on, tried to break me as they had so many times before, but I wouldn't let them.\n\nFinally, the judge asked me to speak.\n\nWith as level a stare as I could muster, I looked at mother, my father, and their lawyer across from me and said \"If you're asking me if I have no respect for my parents, then you are correct. However, to say it's simply financially motivated is incorrect. I no longer have respect for them because they have-\"\n\nAs I was nearly finished, my mother, as she had so many times in the past began to squirm and scream at me from across the table. \"HE'S LYING THE LITTLE BASTARD IS JUS-\"\n\nUntil the Judge slammed his gavel down and cut the room; my mother staring up at him in complete and utter disbelief.\n\nI looked at her, keeping the tears I knew were right behind the corner at bay and said, \"For once in your life; for once in my life, behave as an adult. You can't stop me by simply yelling over me anymore, you have nothing to hold over me now. You can do nothing.\"\n\nAs I spoke, the judge motioned to his officer who moved towards my mother. Her expression still frozen in complete bewilderment as the officer aggressively told her to get up out of her chair and escorted her out of the room.\n\nThe judge looked to me, my aunt, my father, and his lawyer with one sweeping glance and then spoke.\n\n\"I am sorry that you have had to deal with this for so long young man. There's nothing more that you or anyone else needs to say. You deserve to live a normal life as a normal kid and it's obvious to me now that your parents are unfit to produce that kind of environment. You will go back to Texas with your Aunt, and we will regularly have our social workers in touch to check in on how you are doing. Make the most of this second chance, good luck young man. Adjourned.\"\n\nThough the bang of his gavel was the only noise that permeated the room, all I could hear was the ringing in my ears. My father and his lawyer were escorted out of the room and the tears I had held back all this time came gushing out like a tidal wave.\n\nIt's been 7 years since that day and I am happy to say that I've managed to grow up and become a well-adjusted adult. I have a great career, great friends, and an amazing girlfriend. I've been in therapy ever since we got back to Texas, and I no longer have trouble sleeping or terrible bouts of anxiety and depression as I used to.\n\nLife is good.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nMother is a narcissist with dissociative personality disorder addicted to opiates. Father kind of just went with the flow and didn't really do much. Aunt came down to take me to Texas, saw how shit everything was and asked me if I wanted to live with them. After some time I said yes, went to court against my parents under the pretense of emancipation, and got to stare them down and layout all the trauma, pain, and fear they've caused me. My mother was escorted out of the room when she tried to cut over me, and the judge sided with us and I was emancipated. Now I'm doing really well.",

We had one plane that had an issue on takeoff and veered off the runway, it cartwheeled and totaled the airplane but fortunately the pilot was not serious injured.  I had a student who was next in line for takeoff when it happened, he called me from his phone as it happened.  I hopped in the airport car with one of the rampers and drove out to the plane with a radio to inform inbound planes to use the other runway (we had no control tower).  On the way to the runway I called the airport manager who drove to the airport and on his way he made a phone call to officially closed that runway.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later a metric fuckton of DPS officers showed up and immediately tried to close the whole airport, treating it like a giant crime scene.  They were carelessley driving around the airport like they owned the place, ignoring the planes that were moving around, and crossing our only open runway without regard to inbound traffic.  A mechanic and I tried to tell them to be careful and they got mad at us.  One of them told me they were \"locking it down\" a couple times, meaning the whole airport.  Now I was a broke ass flight instructor and I had a flight that afternoon that was ultimately going to help pay for me to eat that week.\n\nThe airport manager was a short stereotypical country guy, also former Navy.  He was not intimidated at all by the cops trying to close his airport.  When he showed up I was about to go out with a student who was preflighting for a cross-country.  There were about 5 cops in the lobby, me with my flight bag, the airport manager, and a mechanic.  One of the cops saw my flight bag and said \"I don't know why you have that or why he's out a the plane, you aren't going anywhere\", the moment he finished his sentence the airport manager said \"it's one runway that's closed, the airport is still open.  This pissed off the cops.\n\nI was about to head out the door, and one of the officers said he was driving out to the disabled plane.  Idky, the pilot had been gone for about an hour.  The mechanic said \"you need to be careful\" and the cop quickly retorted \"AND WHY THE HELL IS THAT?\" and he said \"because this is still an airport, and the first thing that hits you is going to be a propeller\" a few seconds later a plane took off as one of the cars was approaching the runway intersection ironing in that point.\n\nI walked out, and as I was hopping in the plane with my student the same cop came up to me and said \"you aren't going anywhere, we're locking this down!\"  I looked at the airport manager who followed all of us out to the ramp, he said \"have a nice flight AjaxBU!\" \n\nYou could see these cops just fuming that they didn't have the authority to close down an entire airport because one plane went off the runway.   The airport had two runways, where the disabled plane was located was probably a mile or so away from the open runway.  Why they were making a big fuss, I don't know.  The occupant was relatively uninjured, his wife was the worst thing he had to deal with that day, he told her he wasn't going to fly.\n\nWe had a good flight, and I got to eat dinner that week.",

I kept making excuses, but at one point I couldn't come up with any more excuses. \n\nSo I visited her. She sat me down and asked me why I was renting a house by myself, what caste my room mate was, and told me not to have \"lower caste\" people room with me, all the while subtly trying to find out what caste I was. I hated her. I couldn't really do anything about what she spoke because the HR was not even taking sexual harassment complaints seriously, let alone this one. \n\nAlso it turned out, my apartment's owner was friends with this woman and she had a spare key to my apartment that she stored on behalf of the owner who lived abroad.

I stopped to take a drink of water and she marched up to me going \"WE DON'T PAY YOU TO STAND AROUND DRINKING YOU KNOW!\" to which I calmly responded that I was thirsty, and needed a drink of water, and if she wanted to tell me I wasn't allowed to have a glass of water then good luck, but I'm pretty sure health and safety would have something to say about that. She huffed about not having had a break all day, which I ignored cos not my fucking problem, but internally I was put out about it, because it was totally fucking pointless to be such a twat about things.\n\nAbout 2 weeks in I get promoted to Supervisor as I was clearly extremely competent by their usual standards (I could walk and fart at the same time) but she also gets promoted to Floor Manager, so she continues to work her little power trips and try and lord it over me (and everyone else)\n\n4 weeks after that, I get another promotion to Floor Manager, and at this point we're equals, so she can't boss me around anymore. So instead, she tries a different tack, which is to try and lord it over me with her superior knowledge of processes, where to find stuff etc.\n\nMy response is to go (saccharine sweet) \"Oh thanks! That's so helpful, I mean you know how things work so much better than me, because you've been here 5 years, and I've only been here 6 weeks...\"\n\nShe had a face like a smacked arse.

I loved computers and they thought I'd make a good salesman, so my job was to stay in the computer department and sell computers; nothing else.\n\nWell, one of the shift managers didn't like that, and started insisted that I needed to go fold clothes for a while. As in, half my damn shift. I told him that the store manager had instructed me never to leave the technology department, but he insisted. This went on for several weeks.\n\nThe store manager showed up one weekend when both the power trippin shift manager and I were working. The store manager walks up with the shift manager close behind. Store manager slaps a stack of [greenbar paper](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&ei=iiBuX4PQEoqc5gL8gJLQCg&q=greenbar+paper&oq=greenbar+paper&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB4yBggAEBYQHjIGCAAQFhAeOgQIABBHOgsILhDHARCjAhCTAjoECAAQQzoECAAQCjoECC4QCjoICAAQFhAKEB5Q5g9Y2xRg2RVoAHACeACAAWyIAe8DkgEDNC4ymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiDvZnA4oTsAhUKjlkKHXyABKoQ4dUDCAw&uact=5) (this was a while ago) down onto a shelf and points to some highlighted numbers.\n\nHe looks at the shift manager and says, \"Do you see this? This is our average technology sales numbers for the weeks you are on shift. See this number over here? This is our average technology sales numbers for weeks you are not. At this point, it would be more cost effective for me to simply fire you. What do you think of that solution?\"\n\nThe guy stammers and stutters like a toddler caught bullying another kid on the playground. Fortunately, the dude wasn't fired, but the store manager made it clear that when I was on shift, I was not to leave the technology department unless I was on break or there was a fire in the store. That shift manager never said another word to me.",

My coworker brought a lot of experience and skills to the table so many executives and bosses want him working on their projects in their departments in their umbrella of the company. When it was time for him to ask for a raise, our manager, director, and executive director turned him down and low balled him with a counter offer so insultingly low he started looking for jobs outside of the company.\n\nCFO, and other senior VPs heard about said move and reached out to him to get him to stay, and they worked it out amongst each other so they can share him in their special projects along with a hefty compensation package.\n\nCoworker being respectful puts in a request to transfer that has to be approved by the current manager, director, and executive director which they promptly turned down. To make matters worse, they go ahead and write him up for \"attendance\" problems from a couple of months ago... We're all salary, and for the most part project based.\n\nThroughout all of this, I am a fly on the wall since we shared an office, here I am laughing with him while he was in phone calls with the literal people who ran the company. He was told to ignore all that, they apologized to him, they got VP of Human Relations in on the meeting explained the situation which then launched an internal investigation unbeknownst to the 3 clowns.\n\nthe ensuing shit storm that came down onto the 3 clowns is more than enough to make this story awesome, but the cherry on top, is that he is now their boss...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr: \"management\" team tries to screw over an employee who ends up being their boss.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE**: thank you for the award, and as a thank you, I will share the rest of the tea, sorry for the delay. \n\nthe way it would've worked before all this went down, is that, said executive director was gonna be promoted into a VP position and move into the big player's lounge in our main office, director which is clown#2 would've taken EXECdir spot, and clown#3 which was manager would've taken director job. \n\nThe powers that may be, CFO, senior VPs that were working behind the scenes took this opportunity to let the clowns dig a hole for themselves.  and to everybody's delight, they did. \n\nI'm going to start with the matter at hand, CFO and senior VPs told my coworker to sit tight, and they will make sure that he is taken care of, and that he from then on will be only taking instructions from them, with the VP of HR on the phone, the process of re-routing him up the chain of command went super fast. I mean why wouldn't it, the bosses who would've reviewed and approved all this have been working behind the scenes to make it happen and they are all on the phone now. My coworker was told that by the next business day he just had to fill in the proper paperwork and to send it straight to VP of HR, and formal announcements will be made to the rest of the company by the end of the week. My coworker then asked the bosses to use some of his newly granted compensation for a vacation week, just to avoid the drama.  \n\nTHIS WEEK was glorious. The clowns were busy calling my coworker, blowing up his phone. LOVING the drama that was going on, I was texting him updates. Since clown #1,2, and 3 always relied on us salaried grunts to take care of everything for them, their incompetence kept showing in their \"BIG\" projects. Projects that have to be submitted to the same CFO and senior VPs that caused all this for them. Every one of our internal clients (other departments, execs, and bosses within the company) was looking for my coworker, the incompetency of the clowns have spread across at the management level, they are all now bypassing them and going straight to us to get things done. \n\nHR was prompted by the VP of HR to start investigations in the background and we were all interviewed and sworn to secrecy. \n\nThe end of the week comes, and my coworker comes in, brand new suit, sits on his desk, and we start our usual banter.  This is supposed to be the day of the big announcement. Clown #3 calls my coworker into the office to write him up for as many things as clown #3 can. \\*\\*\\*\\*THIS I CANNOT CONFIRM because I'm only hearing this from my coworker\\*\\*\\*\\* but apparently clown#3 was putting the book down on him, and threatened termination due to the number of offenses (they wouldn't have fired him, they needed him that much)\n\nMy coworker has a habit of giving a deadpan face and just shrugging through everything that is not interesting to him, so apparently that's what he did. \n\nWhat I can confirm is that after this meeting, he showed me an email of said clown#3 scheduling a meeting with him and clown #2, and #1. WHICHHHH HE DECLINES IN FRONT OF ME...he laughs, looks at me, says watch this,  he walks out, and after some time comes back into the building with the Senior VP straight to clown#1's office Exec Dir.\n\nsome time passes and it was fun to watch Clown #2 Director, and Clown #3 Manager rush to the same office. \n\nThey were all passed over for the promotions, were not granted their raises, and now all their projects go to my coworker for approval. \n\nI no longer work for the company, after some more drama I have moved on as well. I'm still in touch with my coworker, the last update I have heard is that clown #1 and #2 exec director and director would be retiring this year after so long with the company. \n\nI heard that #3 burnt the team to the ground due to sheer incompetence, and is on the way out as well. #3 started the team with a total of 9 direct reports now down to 2.",

When that happens it fucking creeps me out so I won't sleep the rest of the night.\n\nEdit 1: Why don't I move or cover the mirror? The first time it happened, I covered the mirror but with my morning rushes to work, I pull the cloth down to get ready, and then cover it when I reach home. I've had and still have peaceful nights of sleep (with dimmed lights on) so eventually I'd skip on covering mirror and focussed more not being afraid of the dark. When I least expect it, I then I catch myself waking up to the mirror with a gentle head bump/nod. Get spooked at the incident, rinse and repeat with a blanket cover. I generally have good nights of sleep, these sleepwalks are very rare so I'm really I'm more concerned about my fear of sleeping in the dark. I can't do it. I need a dimmed light for bedtime.\n\nEdit 2: Is it this particular mirror in my room? Yes, it's always this mirror but maybe I haven't had enough sleepovers to have another sleepwalking state elsewhere. I think it's just my subconscious self remembering how I like the mirror during the daytime to get ready, do my hair, makeup, try clothes, etc. I live in a shared flat so I can only leave it in my room. It's a cheap full length mirror and anyway, these sleep walks are so rare. Recent 'episodes' HAS made me want to leave the mirror outside my room but then again I don't want to weird out my flatmates by describing them this particular sleeping habit.",

It was their debut album and one of only two they made in this particular \"incarnation\" as Christian rockers - their third album was *Dubnobasswithmyheadman* which took them in a different direction and launched them (and their genre) into the mainstream. Most people consider that their \"real\" first album, and it's a legitimate classic, but *Underneath* is a remarkably well-produced and consistently solid album from start to finish. Highlights are \"Glory! Glory!\", \"Rubber Ball (Space Kitchen)\", and the title track.",

I would also like to add that if anybody reads this, and you feel somewhat lost while in the Military, don\u2019t be afraid to go to medical and talk about it. It happens unfortunately often where speaking directly to your chain of command will not help things and word can travel fast. But there is absolutely nothing wrong in seeking help to allow yourself to be the best Marine/Sailor or whatever title you gave your all to achieve.

The L.A.P.D. was so convinced that they had their man that they tried to make the evidence fit the suspect rather than allowing the evidence to lead them to a suspect. \n\nO.J. didn't do it: \n\nNicole Brown was nearly decapitated and Ron Goldman was stabbed 20+ times. The prosecution claimed the injuries were consistent with two knives being used and produced a stiletto knife -good for stabbing but not cutting- and a Swiss Army knife -not really good for hurting anyone other than yourself. Ron Goldman had numerous defensive wounds and the injuries to his hands indicated that he had landed numerous blows yet O.J. had only a small cut on his hand with no other evidence of having been in a fight. The only evidence found in O.J.'s home were a few drops of his own blood which were contaminated with a preservative used in blood draws.\n\nJason did it: \n\nMeans: Jason was employed as a sous-chef and had his own knife set and also owned a double-edged combat knife.\n\nMotive: Jason was cooking alone at his restaurant that night and had specifically invited Nicole to come see him cook. She stood him up and went to Mezzaluna where Ron Goldman worked. Jason was known to be bothered by Nicole seeing men other than his father.\n\nOpportunity: Jason's timecard that night was handwritten for a time much later than when the restaurant shut down. His alibi changed multiple times, but the last time anyone can definitely account for him is around 9:30 that night.\n\nThe kicker? The day after the murders, O.J. retained one of L.A.'s top criminal defense attorneys for Jason and did not hire his own defense attorney until several days later.",
