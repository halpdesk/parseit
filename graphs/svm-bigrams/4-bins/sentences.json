                "sent": "Well, this might be a long one.\n\nI grew up around a mother with dissociative disorder as well as narcissism. She was addicted to opiates as far back as I can remember, and would do anything to get them, and I mean anything.\n\nGrowing up, it wasn't rare for her to have a tantrum during one of her highs and beat the shit out of me, break me down by picking apart every little thing she knew I was afraid or self-conscious of, and actively sabotage my relationship with my father and siblings.\n\nShe would be up for days at a time, pass out standing up with her eyes glassed over and back hunched, and when she festered once again start moving and otherwise destroying everything in the house.\n\nThere were times where I'd leave and the house would be clean, and come home and it would look as though a pissed off tornado had run through the house i.e. broken glass, animal feces, dirty clothes, roaches, empty pill bottles, ground-up pill residue, and other miscellaneous things littering the house. On particularly bad nights she would hallucinate, and during those times it wouldn't be uncommon to find pools of her blood on the ground from running through glass.\n\nI remember being up for days at a time because her and my father would scream at each other for days at a time without stopping; actively trying to get me to pick one side or the other even if it meant barging into my room at 4 am to begin their screaming match where I could watch.\n\nShe manipulated me, abandoned me at times in the middle of nowhere when she'd meet up with her various sugar daddies (she was still with my dad during this), and never once apologized during her brief moments of mental clarity. If anything, she would blame everything but herself. In her mind she was infallible.\n\nMoney was always a big issue since she couldn't work in such a state. She sold some of her pills, yes, but ultimately those funds were used to buy more drugs anyway. Because of this, we were homeless frequently, without power and water for literally years at a time, and barely ever had any food. It was almost every night I went to sleep with the only thing I'd have eaten that day being a school lunch. On weekends, sometimes I didn't eat at all.\n\nThe rest of my family had no clue this was happening. During the summer when I was 16, my aunt whom I hadn't talked much with since I was a lot younger got in touch. She asked if I'd like to come to stay with them in Texas for a few weeks during the summer.\n\nOf course I said yes, and I was absolutely ecstatic. I didn't bother asking my parents since I'd be very much surprised if they even noticed I was gone so they were unaware. My aunt drove up all the way to Iowa and stayed the afternoon with us.\n\nMy parents seemed to lack the cognition to recognize she was even there out of the blue so they didn't come out of their room. As I stated before would happen frequently, when she arrived our house was fairly clean. We left for a bit to go get food, and when we returned the tornado had already passed.\n\nAs she told me when we were on our way to Texas: the thing that bothered her the most wasn't that our house had suddenly gone to hell, it was that I didn't even react to it. Instead, I tiptoed around the debris and started packing my things without a word.\n\nThis deeply unsettled her, and ultimately she asked me if I was safe where I lived. I said yes, as it was all I had ever known. She told me that what she saw frightened her, and she wanted me to come live with her in Texas. Thinking that she was joking, I brushed it off. After a few days down there though, I knew I had to do it. They showed me love, compassion, and care that I'd never even known existed prior to this and it shook me to my core.\n\nSo we decided, I was going to get emancipated from my parents and move in with them. Ultimately, this involved sitting in a courthouse across from my parents and their lawyer.\n\nThe judge asked why I wanted to leave, and I explained the above. I expressed the love and compassion I'd experienced for the first time in my life, and that I wanted to, for once, live in peace.\n\nTheir lawyer rebutted, \"To me, it seems as though you have no respect for your parents. Is it because of their financial situation? It looks as though you're attached to the perks of living in a family that makes a reasonable amount of money, and not that you want to leave because they're unfit parents.\"\n\nMy mother and father joined in, hooting and hollering actively trying to break me down as they have so many times before.\n\nI let him speak, I let them speak, and I held my tongue until it was my turn. They tried to goad me on, tried to break me as they had so many times before, but I wouldn't let them.\n\nFinally, the judge asked me to speak.\n\nWith as level a stare as I could muster, I looked at mother, my father, and their lawyer across from me and said \"If you're asking me if I have no respect for my parents, then you are correct. However, to say it's simply financially motivated is incorrect. I no longer have respect for them because they have-\"\n\nAs I was nearly finished, my mother, as she had so many times in the past began to squirm and scream at me from across the table. \"HE'S LYING THE LITTLE BASTARD IS JUS-\"\n\nUntil the Judge slammed his gavel down and cut the room; my mother staring up at him in complete and utter disbelief.\n\nI looked at her, keeping the tears I knew were right behind the corner at bay and said, \"For once in your life; for once in my life, behave as an adult. You can't stop me by simply yelling over me anymore, you have nothing to hold over me now. You can do nothing.\"\n\nAs I spoke, the judge motioned to his officer who moved towards my mother. Her expression still frozen in complete bewilderment as the officer aggressively told her to get up out of her chair and escorted her out of the room.\n\nThe judge looked to me, my aunt, my father, and his lawyer with one sweeping glance and then spoke.\n\n\"I am sorry that you have had to deal with this for so long young man. There's nothing more that you or anyone else needs to say. You deserve to live a normal life as a normal kid and it's obvious to me now that your parents are unfit to produce that kind of environment. You will go back to Texas with your Aunt, and we will regularly have our social workers in touch to check in on how you are doing. Make the most of this second chance, good luck young man. Adjourned.\"\n\nThough the bang of his gavel was the only noise that permeated the room, all I could hear was the ringing in my ears. My father and his lawyer were escorted out of the room and the tears I had held back all this time came gushing out like a tidal wave.\n\nIt's been 7 years since that day and I am happy to say that I've managed to grow up and become a well-adjusted adult. I have a great career, great friends, and an amazing girlfriend. I've been in therapy ever since we got back to Texas, and I no longer have trouble sleeping or terrible bouts of anxiety and depression as I used to.\n\nLife is good.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nMother is a narcissist with dissociative personality disorder addicted to opiates. Father kind of just went with the flow and didn't really do much. Aunt came down to take me to Texas, saw how shit everything was and asked me if I wanted to live with them. After some time I said yes, went to court against my parents under the pretense of emancipation, and got to stare them down and layout all the trauma, pain, and fear they've caused me. My mother was escorted out of the room when she tried to cut over me, and the judge sided with us and I was emancipated. Now I'm doing really well.",

I've already marked it up, English teacher style with a red pen and start with, \"I had some trouble understanding your report.\" I proceeded to go error by error for the purpose of \"clarifying\" the report. He's getting redder and redder. I then go into trying to determine why he pulled over the defendant because it's unclear in the report. He's not able to give a definitive response.\n\nAll the while, the sherriff's rep, whom I've worked with a lot and who I have seen be very vocal protecting deputies in interviews like this in the past, is silent. Ultimately, charges against client are dropped.\n\nMonths later, I'm driving through the area on the way home from camping, not speeding or breaking any traffic laws. I get pulled over by a deputy.

But all other floors were no problem.  \n  \nMy dad arrived to find the maintenance guy cackling, looking into the bottom of the shaft. There were probably tens of thousands of magazines down there. They had to get a bunch of shovels, a small crew, and a rolling dumpster to clear it out. When it was all done, my dad decided to stay behind and pretend to read a newspaper while he sat in the lobby. After about half an hour, he sees an elderly patient holding a magazine, shuffling slowly toward the elevator. He stops in front of the doors, glances left, glances right, and quickly stoops down, slides the magazine into the gap, and shuffles away as fast as he can with a huge grin on his face. My dad could not help but laugh hysterically. This guy had probably been sliding magazines in there multiple times per day, every day, for decades. I should ask him whether he reported it or let the guy have his fun. Wouldn't surprise me if my dad went with the latter.",

She somehow also got management backing to do pretty much whatever she wanted - giving punishments, changing schedules without asking anyone, and so on.\n\nShe had this going for several months, until she made one big mistake. According to what I heard, at least, she chirped to the resident math teacher that \"married women who do not cover their hair go to hell\". Said math teacher, of course, was a married woman who did not cover her hair, and did not appreciate this comment.\n\nAbout a week later, Mrs. Isaac decided she is pulling her class from all other classes for a bible prep marathon. Now, to be fair, there WAS a big exam coming, but you could say that about most of the other classes, too.\n\nShe sent a random 7th grader to our English classroom, to tell the teacher that we're being called for a prep marathon.\n\n\"Who is calling?\".\n\n\"Mrs. Isaac.\"\n\n\"Oh. In that case, it's a no.\"\n\nWe were utterly shocked, and amused, because... That's not a thing teachers did? \n\nShe made a few other attempts, but it seems all of the teachers decided they had enough, and flat out refused to send us to her little prep marathon.\n\nThe best part came on Thursday the same week. She sent in yet another 7th grader to call us. Except this time - it was Math class.\n\n\"Who's calling them?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Isaac.\"\n\n\"So it doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"But Mrs. Isaac said-\".\n\n\"I know. I don't care.\"",

I really hope anyone who will read this will take a moment to check on their friends, so many people don't and even if they want you to or not, it will make them feel more loved in the long run.\n\nPotential trigger warnings below, so just be warned.

The last 2-3 years I have been doing much much better and I don't really consider myself suicidal anymore, but for the sake of this I will include this year in the tally because I had a bad month a few months back.!<\n\n>!There have been 3 very distinct times in my life where I almost killed myself. First was when I was in high school, I started drinking every day and blacking out all the time, I did drugs and drank every day. I hated life and just wanted to feel something else. One night I was extremely wasted and decided to go walk around town. I was standing next to the road and was waiting to just jump in front of a bust or large truck. While waiting I was thinking about the reasons I didn't want to be alive. After an hour of thinking all the bad things, I started thinking about reasons I might want to be alive... This first time was because I promised myself that I wouldn't make my mom bury another child (my sister died before I was born).!<\n\n>!The second time I was 8 months out of HS, same scenario as above with all the drugs and all. This time I had a gun to my head, I was going to pull the trigger, but when I did my finger wouldn't move.  I put the gun down and cried. This time I remembered that I wanted to move away some day and see new places, I couldn't die before I left my hometown and had new experiences.!<\n\n>!The third time was my closest time. I was in college and my entire life fell apart. GF left me, lost my job, had to drop out of school, one of my pets died, I lost a good friend, my life literally collapsed around me. I took an entire bottle of pain killers, mixed an entire bottle of vodka with it and then went to sleep. I woke up 30 minutes later with the worst pain of my life. I could have just took the pain, but once I felt that, once I felt something that made me actually feel alive I called my friend. He knew I was suicidal and knew that I would probably try something soon. He was on call for me 24/7. He picked me up, forced me to throw up and then rushed me to the ER to get my stomach pumped. I decided to fight it because I actually realized that I WANT TO BE ALIVE, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO LIVE.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!From that day on, I have tried my best to be happy, its been 3 years now, and I have only been in a slump where I was slightly suicidal for 6 days out of 3 years. My depression tried killing me, I didn't try to kill me. That is how I think about it. So now I fight my depression, instead of being my depression.!<\n\nEdit: I got so emotional writing this I forgot to mention my cat really helped me with my depression.

                "sent": "\nIt\u2019s finally my time to shine!!\n\nIt was Christmas Day, 2010. I was 10, my brother was 12. I was in that stage of my life where I greatly admired my brother, and basically followed him around and did what he ordered me to do.\n\nAt this given moment, my nan and her boyfriend were at the table sitting outside enjoying the sunshine and listening to Mariah Carey. My mum,  preparing the Christmas feast of ham and roast veg. My dad, probably trying to figure out how to make ice with the new ice machine and cursing his existence.\n\nNow for a little more context, I\u2019ve grown up in the Australian suburbs. This is important to reference, as it explains why my brother and I were trying to peep over the fence to see what our loud neighbours were doing. You\u2019re probably confused...I\u2019ll explain. In Australia, it\u2019s common culture to extend to your neighbours, or the entire street, an invitation into the family.\n\nThis includes inviting them over to celebrate birthdays, having afternoon siestas on the front lawn, joint Australia Day bbqs, that kind of thing.\nHowever, my family was never really close to the neighbours behind us. I personally feel like this is because they never cut their bloody tree that\u2019s palms dipped into our yard. \n\nAnyway, on this particular Christmas, those neighbours were being louder than usual. My brother, being the nosey bastard he is, decided he wanted to see what the commotion was all about. So he decided he had a plan; get a chair, put it against the fence and look over. \n\nBut alas, this plan would not work, as the way the chair was positioned, my brother would surely topple over. Cue my involvement. I sat down in that chair as if my life depended on it. My brother needed my help, so I\u2019d be sure to give it. I watched as my brother climbed the chair, using the headrest as a step. \nHe peered over. \nI caught my breath. \nIt felt like eternity before my brother started to jitter and panic. \n\n\n\n\u201cWHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?!\u201d\n\n\n\nHOLY TURTLE DOVES, \nI thought, as my brother clambered down the fence. The bloody neighbours had seen his boof of a head peering into their yard. Now panicking as well, I yelled at my brother to hurry down so I could runaway myself, but that wasn\u2019t before the incident occurred.\n\nThe life changing moment that gave me my scar.\n\nI bet you\u2019re wondering how it happened? Did my brother somehow topple the chair over and make me fall, cutting my hand on the pot plant below? No. Or did the neighbour throw over a cricket ball in anger, it landing on my head and causing me to bleed and have a little Harry Potter scar?\n\nNot even close. \n\nAs my brother rushed down from the fence, his feet came too close to my face. His big toe specifically. And in a moment you could say was set on 0.75 speed, his toe nail collided with my cheek, cutting my face.\n\nHe landed safely on the floor and ran to the outdoor table, including himself in my nan and her partner\u2019s conversation as if nothing happened. But I knew something was wrong. My bloody face was burning!\n\nI abandoned the chair and the yells of fury behind me and darted for the bathroom. I looked in horror at my new battle wound.\n\nMy god, I looked like a prisoner you wouldn\u2019t want to fuck with. The cut resembled la teardrop. Almost exactly so. It was rather fascinating in a way. But the stinging overcame the wonderment.\n\nI cleaned the wound as best as I could, being 10 years old and not very bright, and stuck a band aid on it. I know.\n\nI walked out and copied my brother; sitting at the table and acting like nothing happened. Of course everyone picked up on the bandaid, but I simply said I wanted to be a Christmas Pirate (doesn\u2019t make any sense? I know) and they moved on.\n\nTo this day, I have that scar. Yes, it still resembles a tear drop.",
