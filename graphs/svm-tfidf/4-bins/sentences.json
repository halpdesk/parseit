I stopped to take a drink of water and she marched up to me going \"WE DON'T PAY YOU TO STAND AROUND DRINKING YOU KNOW!\" to which I calmly responded that I was thirsty, and needed a drink of water, and if she wanted to tell me I wasn't allowed to have a glass of water then good luck, but I'm pretty sure health and safety would have something to say about that. She huffed about not having had a break all day, which I ignored cos not my fucking problem, but internally I was put out about it, because it was totally fucking pointless to be such a twat about things.\n\nAbout 2 weeks in I get promoted to Supervisor as I was clearly extremely competent by their usual standards (I could walk and fart at the same time) but she also gets promoted to Floor Manager, so she continues to work her little power trips and try and lord it over me (and everyone else)\n\n4 weeks after that, I get another promotion to Floor Manager, and at this point we're equals, so she can't boss me around anymore. So instead, she tries a different tack, which is to try and lord it over me with her superior knowledge of processes, where to find stuff etc.\n\nMy response is to go (saccharine sweet) \"Oh thanks!

I ask if there is anything we can do at which time the owner comes over to see what the issue is.\n\nI explain it to him and he proceeds to chastise me, saying we must not have ordered it correctly, if we need it so long why are we 35 minutes late, and a bunch of other down talk. By this time my father comes in to see why I have not come out, and also gets talked down to which upsets me internally. I tell the owner that we need to move at least the big things, so if we only have 3 hours we will make it work the best we can (then rent another truck elsewhere during the week) but he keeps chewing up more time arguing then says the kicker. He will look up the call recording to see who is right. I have absolute trust in my father when he says he did something, so I agree and wait.\n\nTurns out the owner was the one that took the call and he gets smug. \"I have done this for 20 some years and I don't make mistakes.\" Five minutes later, sounding defeated, he is asking us to bring it back early so we don't mess up another person's move (guilting us for his mistake that he never makes). On the call you clearly hear my father asking for the 24 hour rental with multiple confirmations from the owner throughout the call. Guy was a real jerk, never even apologized for anything. Also left a lengthy detailed review on multiple sites and emailed U-Haul corporate. It is now my most \"helpful\" review on just about every platform.",

I need a dimmed light for bedtime.\n\nEdit 2: Is it this particular mirror in my room? Yes, it's always this mirror but maybe I haven't had enough sleepovers to have another sleepwalking state elsewhere. I think it's just my subconscious self remembering how I like the mirror during the daytime to get ready, do my hair, makeup, try clothes, etc. I live in a shared flat so I can only leave it in my room.

He was PISSED. Left half his order on the counter and started fuming off.\n\nAnticipating his next move, I went back to my original post that night - as manager of the customer service kiosk. Oh boy, the look on his face when he saw me. (Didn\u2019t want a refund of his tickets though so I assume he watched the movie, without popcorn).",

To make matters worse, they go ahead and write him up for \"attendance\" problems from a couple of months ago... We're all salary, and for the most part project based.\n\nThroughout all of this, I am a fly on the wall since we shared an office, here I am laughing with him while he was in phone calls with the literal people who ran the company. He was told to ignore all that, they apologized to him, they got VP of Human Relations in on the meeting explained the situation which then launched an internal investigation unbeknownst to the 3 clowns.\n\nthe ensuing shit storm that came down onto the 3 clowns is more than enough to make this story awesome, but the cherry on top, is that he is now their boss...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr: \"management\" team tries to screw over an employee who ends up being their boss.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE**: thank you for the award, and as a thank you, I will share the rest of the tea, sorry for the delay. \n\nthe way it would've worked before all this went down, is that, said executive director was gonna be promoted into a VP position and move into the big player's lounge in our main office, director which is clown#2 would've taken EXECdir spot, and clown#3 which was manager would've taken director job. \n\nThe powers that may be, CFO, senior VPs that were working behind the scenes took this opportunity to let the clowns dig a hole for themselves.  and to everybody's delight, they did. \n\nI'm going to start with the matter at hand, CFO and senior VPs told my coworker to sit tight, and they will make sure that he is taken care of, and that he from then on will be only taking instructions from them, with the VP of HR on the phone, the process of re-routing him up the chain of command went super fast. I mean why wouldn't it, the bosses who would've reviewed and approved all this have been working behind the scenes to make it happen and they are all on the phone now. My coworker was told that by the next business day he just had to fill in the proper paperwork and to send it straight to VP of HR, and formal announcements will be made to the rest of the company by the end of the week. My coworker then asked the bosses to use some of his newly granted compensation for a vacation week, just to avoid the drama.  \n\nTHIS WEEK was glorious. The clowns were busy calling my coworker, blowing up his phone. LOVING the drama that was going on, I was texting him updates. Since clown #1,2, and 3 always relied on us salaried grunts to take care of everything for them, their incompetence kept showing in their \"BIG\" projects. Projects that have to be submitted to the same CFO and senior VPs that caused all this for them. Every one of our internal clients (other departments, execs, and bosses within the company) was looking for my coworker, the incompetency of the clowns have spread across at the management level, they are all now bypassing them and going straight to us to get things done. \n\nHR was prompted by the VP of HR to start investigations in the background and we were all interviewed and sworn to secrecy. \n\nThe end of the week comes, and my coworker comes in, brand new suit, sits on his desk, and we start our usual banter.  This is supposed to be the day of the big announcement. Clown #3 calls my coworker into the office to write him up for as many things as clown #3 can. \\*\\*\\*\\*THIS I CANNOT CONFIRM because I'm only hearing this from my coworker\\*\\*\\*\\* but apparently clown#3 was putting the book down on him, and threatened termination due to the number of offenses (they wouldn't have fired him, they needed him that much)\n\nMy coworker has a habit of giving a deadpan face and just shrugging through everything that is not interesting to him, so apparently that's what he did. \n\nWhat I can confirm is that after this meeting, he showed me an email of said clown#3 scheduling a meeting with him and clown #2, and #1. WHICHHHH HE DECLINES IN FRONT OF ME...he laughs, looks at me, says watch this,  he walks out, and after some time comes back into the building with the Senior VP straight to clown#1's office Exec Dir.\n\nsome time passes and it was fun to watch Clown #2 Director, and Clown #3 Manager rush to the same office. \n\nThey were all passed over for the promotions, were not granted their raises, and now all their projects go to my coworker for approval. \n\nI no longer work for the company, after some more drama I have moved on as well. I'm still in touch with my coworker, the last update I have heard is that clown #1 and #2 exec director and director would be retiring this year after so long with the company. \n\nI heard that #3 burnt the team to the ground due to sheer incompetence, and is on the way out as well. #3 started the team with a total of 9 direct reports now down to 2.",

                "sent": "I found out my parents wanted to send me to a different secondary school from all my friends, for several reasons that made sense to them, but little lonely me who didn't have many friends was not happy AT ALL to be losing those I had. And then, I found out that not only would I have to start all over again, but this school had lessons...on SATURDAYS.\n\nWell, fuck that. I hated school at that age, weekends were my refuge, and now I was even losing some of  that? Nope. I cried, I begged, pleaded...but their minds were set.\n\nAnd then...and then someone let slip that this school had an entrance exam. It wasn't difficult, I was pretty sure I could pass it, but my parents clearly assumed it was a given, clearly having forgotten that I had free will, or assuming that I was so used to doing what I was told that I'd just do it.\n\nWRONG.\n\nIn my very first act of childhood rebellion (aged 11), I went and told them that if they made me do it, I would fail the entrance exam on purpose.\n\nYou could see that it had not even occurred to them that this could happen. I still remember the moment of pure, unadulterated surprised Pikachu face before the sputtering, shouting, threatening (not violence, just grounding, loss of privileges etc) began. My favourite exchange involved my Mum telling me that I WOULD pass that exam and me responding, \"No I won't. You can't MAKE me,\" and rendering her, for one of the first times in our relationship, speechless.\n\nThe whole thing was as revelatory for them, especially my Mum, as it was for me. I learned to stand up for myself, and that I had free will, and they learned that I wasn't some obedient little girl who would participate without question and was not just always going to meekly fall in line. \n\nThe change of school thing was dropped. I didn't really even get punished too much, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong and my parents (who may have come off sounding terrible but were in fact wonderful, just unaware of the stubbornness they'd gifted their daughter) felt uneasy about teaching me that exercising free will was wrong, particularly as my mum was a teacher. I wasn't allowed a riding lesson that week, and that was it. \n\nFunnily enough, I now think I probably would have been better off changing schools. The reason I didn't have many friends was that I was bullied at school - quiet, academic, wore THE MOST ridiculous glasses (adult-sized, on a 7yo's face, because my sight was so shit that they didn't make lenses the strength I needed in child sizes in the 80s \ud83d\ude44) - so a new start in a new school where no one knew me would have been an opportunity to start over. But the fact that I'd been bullied made that seem like a horror instead of a good thing and I didn't have many friends but those friendships were hard won and close because we were all the outcasts for various reasons (kids SUCK). That school (despite the Saturday lessons) catered for more of my interests and favourite subjects too.\n\nThing is, if my parents had sat me down and talked to me about it, pointing out the positives of a new start and that the school had a curriculum that I'd love, and reassuring me they probably could have talked me into it. The mistake they made was simply trying to steamroller me and ignore my feelings and thoughts. So there's a parenting tip for you.\n\nIf this story ever comes up, my parents deny it, or say I'm misremembering or embellishing it, but I'm honestly not. It was such a moment of revelation to me, such a formative experience that it's imprinted on my memory, the day I learned that I had free will even if it contradicted my parents.",

First was when I was in high school, I started drinking every day and blacking out all the time, I did drugs and drank every day. I hated life and just wanted to feel something else. One night I was extremely wasted and decided to go walk around town. I was standing next to the road and was waiting to just jump in front of a bust or large truck. While waiting I was thinking about the reasons I didn't want to be alive. After an hour of thinking all the bad things, I started thinking about reasons I might want to be alive... This first time was because I promised myself that I wouldn't make my mom bury another child (my sister died before I was born).!<\n\n>!The second time I was 8 months out of HS, same scenario as above with all the drugs and all. This time I had a gun to my head, I was going to pull the trigger, but when I did my finger wouldn't move.  I put the gun down and cried. This time I remembered that I wanted to move away some day and see new places, I couldn't die before I left my hometown and had new experiences.!<\n\n>!The third time was my closest time. I was in college and my entire life fell apart. GF left me, lost my job, had to drop out of school, one of my pets died, I lost a good friend, my life literally collapsed around me. I took an entire bottle of pain killers, mixed an entire bottle of vodka with it and then went to sleep. I woke up 30 minutes later with the worst pain of my life. I could have just took the pain, but once I felt that, once I felt something that made me actually feel alive I called my friend. He knew I was suicidal and knew that I would probably try something soon. He was on call for me 24/7. He picked me up, forced me to throw up and then rushed me to the ER to get my stomach pumped. I decided to fight it because I actually realized that I WANT TO BE ALIVE, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO LIVE.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!From that day on, I have tried my best to be happy, its been 3 years now, and I have only been in a slump where I was slightly suicidal for 6 days out of 3 years. My depression tried killing me, I didn't try to kill me. That is how I think about it. So now I fight my depression, instead of being my depression.!<\n\nEdit: I got so emotional writing this I forgot to mention my cat really helped me with my depression.

I wish I could make a love letter explaining to every developer personally how they saved me through those dark times by creating media which started from simple arcade games to breathing worlds that also are cinematic masterpieces. Sometimes the gameplay makes up for it instead of the story while sometimes you need a bit of story with that gameplay. I'll just point out the main one.\n\nValve, thank you for making media which helped me through dark times. I've played most of the games that you've made from l4d to cs 1.6...I can't thank you enough for bringing memories and a distraction to keep me away from that noose, even if you're a business I want you to succeed further since you've earned it. I loved the left 4 dead series and replayed portal & half-life multiple times over, not to mention the mods too. You deserved the break up until half-life alex and the fact that you even made hl:a gives me hope for the gaming industry. I love valve and I hope you do too!",

The entire COVID shutdown happens in March, around the same time university acceptances are starting to be sent out. Each first year student has guaranteed residence. \n\nEveryone is wondering what the new teaching model will be, and it\u2019s announced that it\u2019s mixed. 30% in person, 70% online. \n\nAt this point, if you\u2019re in first year, and all your courses are online, why pay for residence? You can do class online. But the university sees these discussions, and know they\u2019ll lose A LOT of money if they don\u2019t have students in residence. \n\nSo what is announced? Almost EVERY first year has at least 1 person class. Meaning? They have to be on campus. MEANING, they have to live in residence. \n\nIdk if this makes sense to anyone but I thought it was interesting.",
