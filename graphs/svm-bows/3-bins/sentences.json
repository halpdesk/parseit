So not only was it hot out and we\u2019re all in tuxes serving a shit-ton of people, the family of the bride who are funding this affair are some of the rudest and most-demanding people imaginable, so it was not the most fun gig in general. \n\nWell, one of the aunts on the bride\u2019s turned out to be the rudest of the bunch and kept trying to pull the \u201cI\u2019m related to the bride so give me give me give me\u201d-act (even though she wasn\u2019t even in the fucking wedding party), and was just making the lives of any one of us who came in contact with her even more of a living hell than what we were experiencing, including the owner of the company, who was lead bartender at the main bar. \n\nNow that point is key because, by some grace of whatever higher power/force/fate/kismet or whatever you call it, I was also working that same bar, which gave me the opportunity to bear witness to the most beautifully constructed instance of comeuppance to which I had ever seen to that point, and don\u2019t expect to ever see it bettered again: the nightmare bitch aunt is in young bossman\u2019s bar line, and loudly complaining the whole time how long it\u2019s taking, and she shouldn\u2019t even have to be waiting in a line anyway because she\u2019s whatever-the-bride\u2019s name\u2019s aunt, blah-blah-blah, just making a huge stink.

I tell the fellow behind the desk that this should be for 24 hours, and he says it is not in the system and it is spoken for already after we return it for another rental. I ask if there is anything we can do at which time the owner comes over to see what the issue is.\n\nI explain it to him and he proceeds to chastise me, saying we must not have ordered it correctly, if we need it so long why are we 35 minutes late, and a bunch of other down talk. By this time my father comes in to see why I have not come out, and also gets talked down to which upsets me internally. I tell the owner that we need to move at least the big things, so if we only have 3 hours we will make it work the best we can (then rent another truck elsewhere during the week) but he keeps chewing up more time arguing then says the kicker. He will look up the call recording to see who is right. I have absolute trust in my father when he says he did something, so I agree and wait.\n\nTurns out the owner was the one that took the call and he gets smug. \"I have done this for 20 some years and I don't make mistakes.\" Five minutes later, sounding defeated, he is asking us to bring it back early so we don't mess up another person's move (guilting us for his mistake that he never makes). On the call you clearly hear my father asking for the 24 hour rental with multiple confirmations from the owner throughout the call. Guy was a real jerk, never even apologized for anything.

And then, I found out that not only would I have to start all over again, but this school had lessons...on SATURDAYS.\n\nWell, fuck that. I hated school at that age, weekends were my refuge, and now I was even losing some of  that? Nope. I cried, I begged, pleaded...but their minds were set.\n\nAnd then...and then someone let slip that this school had an entrance exam. It wasn't difficult, I was pretty sure I could pass it, but my parents clearly assumed it was a given, clearly having forgotten that I had free will, or assuming that I was so used to doing what I was told that I'd just do it.\n\nWRONG.\n\nIn my very first act of childhood rebellion (aged 11), I went and told them that if they made me do it, I would fail the entrance exam on purpose.\n\nYou could see that it had not even occurred to them that this could happen. I still remember the moment of pure, unadulterated surprised Pikachu face before the sputtering, shouting, threatening (not violence, just grounding, loss of privileges etc) began. My favourite exchange involved my Mum telling me that I WOULD pass that exam and me responding, \"No I won't. You can't MAKE me,\" and rendering her, for one of the first times in our relationship, speechless.\n\nThe whole thing was as revelatory for them, especially my Mum, as it was for me. I learned to stand up for myself, and that I had free will, and they learned that I wasn't some obedient little girl who would participate without question and was not just always going to meekly fall in line. \n\nThe change of school thing was dropped. I didn't really even get punished too much, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong and my parents (who may have come off sounding terrible but were in fact wonderful, just unaware of the stubbornness they'd gifted their daughter) felt uneasy about teaching me that exercising free will was wrong, particularly as my mum was a teacher. I wasn't allowed a riding lesson that week, and that was it. \n\nFunnily enough, I now think I probably would have been better off changing schools. The reason I didn't have many friends was that I was bullied at school - quiet, academic, wore THE MOST ridiculous glasses (adult-sized, on a 7yo's face, because my sight was so shit that they didn't make lenses the strength I needed in child sizes in the 80s \ud83d\ude44) - so a new start in a new school where no one knew me would have been an opportunity to start over. But the fact that I'd been bullied made that seem like a horror instead of a good thing and I didn't have many friends but those friendships were hard won and close because we were all the outcasts for various reasons (kids SUCK). That school (despite the Saturday lessons) catered for more of my interests and favourite subjects too.\n\nThing is, if my parents had sat me down and talked to me about it, pointing out the positives of a new start and that the school had a curriculum that I'd love, and reassuring me they probably could have talked me into it. The mistake they made was simply trying to steamroller me and ignore my feelings and thoughts. So there's a parenting tip for you.\n\nIf this story ever comes up, my parents deny it, or say I'm misremembering or embellishing it, but I'm honestly not. It was such a moment of revelation to me, such a formative experience that it's imprinted on my memory, the day I learned that I had free will even if it contradicted my parents.",

The L.A.P.D. was so convinced that they had their man that they tried to make the evidence fit the suspect rather than allowing the evidence to lead them to a suspect. \n\nO.J. didn't do it: \n\nNicole Brown was nearly decapitated and Ron Goldman was stabbed 20+ times. The prosecution claimed the injuries were consistent with two knives being used and produced a stiletto knife -good for stabbing but not cutting- and a Swiss Army knife -not really good for hurting anyone other than yourself. Ron Goldman had numerous defensive wounds and the injuries to his hands indicated that he had landed numerous blows yet O.J. had only a small cut on his hand with no other evidence of having been in a fight. The only evidence found in O.J.'s home were a few drops of his own blood which were contaminated with a preservative used in blood draws.\n\nJason did it: \n\nMeans: Jason was employed as a sous-chef and had his own knife set and also owned a double-edged combat knife.\n\nMotive: Jason was cooking alone at his restaurant that night and had specifically invited Nicole to come see him cook. She stood him up and went to Mezzaluna where Ron Goldman worked. Jason was known to be bothered by Nicole seeing men other than his father.\n\nOpportunity: Jason's timecard that night was handwritten for a time much later than when the restaurant shut down. His alibi changed multiple times, but the last time anyone can definitely account for him is around 9:30 that night.\n\nThe kicker? The day after the murders, O.J. retained one of L.A.'s top criminal defense attorneys for Jason and did not hire his own defense attorney until several days later.",
