He obviously didn't know shit about my industry and every time he would say something wrong, I would try to politely correct him and he'd either backtrack or insist that I was trained wrong. When we got to the site OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEST TEXAS DESERT, he complained about the layer of dust on everything and \"ordered me\" to clean up the entire site.\n\nWhen I sat down at my desk, the guy continued to bitch my ear off about everything that was wrong and chastised me for sitting down at my desk when he told me to clean up the site. So I called for a taxi, filled out a notice of termination, and handed it to him. He looked absolutely shocked. Then he defiantly protested that only <CEO> could fire him.

Now I could already tell from the way the kid explained it in exasperated terms that he knew he couldn't cancel out of it, but his Dad wasn't taking his word for it and had dragged him in to try and 'sort it out' for him.\n\nThe contracts clearly state you can't cancel prematurely without paying off the rest of your dues, which I explained, and his father just went full Boomer Rage mode on me.

By this time my father comes in to see why I have not come out, and also gets talked down to which upsets me internally. I tell the owner that we need to move at least the big things, so if we only have 3 hours we will make it work the best we can (then rent another truck elsewhere during the week) but he keeps chewing up more time arguing then says the kicker. He will look up the call recording to see who is right. I have absolute trust in my father when he says he did something, so I agree and wait.\n\nTurns out the owner was the one that took the call and he gets smug. \"I have done this for 20 some years and I don't make mistakes.\" Five minutes later, sounding defeated, he is asking us to bring it back early so we don't mess up another person's move (guilting us for his mistake that he never makes). On the call you clearly hear my father asking for the 24 hour rental with multiple confirmations from the owner throughout the call. Guy was a real jerk, never even apologized for anything.

Have a good sleep routine. Talk about your problems. Learn to experience and express your emotions in healthy ways.\n\nDo your homework. It's not about proving you can do some rote, boring shit, It's about forming a good study habit. Even if you don't go to college or university, learning how to learn will help you immensely.\n\nLearn about finances, taxes, bills. and insurance early. Get your parents to involve you in the mundane adult stuff, so you aren't caught unawares when reality hits *you*.\n\nLearn the skills that were commonplace for older generations, such as cursive, Latin, and geography. And ffs, learn to navigate without gps, learn to \"read the room\".\n\nAt some point, possibly into adulthood, read books on regular etiquette, and \"Robert's Rules of Order\" (which governs/establishes guiding principles/etiquette for everything from business meetings to congressional hearings). You'll understand why older people have such weird expectations.\n\nIf you aren't ready to accept responsibility for something, don't tangle with it. If you can't raise a kid right now, be choosy about your partners (do you really want to be stuck with this person in your life? Co-parenting with someone manipulative is absolute torture), and be extremely careful when you do have sex. Pregnancy isn't the only worry here.... Likewise, you may want to move out, but honestly it's best to stay home and save your money as long as you can. Most rents cost about twice as much as a mortgage in the same area/neighborhood. The difference-maker is whether you have the capital to put down and the credit for a reasonable interest rate (build your credit to get a better rate).\n\nEdit: on --> in",

It was around 10 C, in Early November.  When you mix in wool suits, drinking, and lots of dancing, some of us Colonists were working up a bit of a sweat.    Thankfully, the venue had a balcony, with huge doors.    \n\n\nI kept going over and opening them, as some folks were inside, some were outside, and there was a nice breeze... but... I had to keep going over, because they were shut whenever I looked back.  \n\n\nFinally, after the 5th or 6th time, this guy followed me, and demanded I keep the doors shut because it was cold inside.  I didn't know who he was, so he must have been a +1 of someone on my wife's side, so I was mighty confused when he said, and I quote \"Who the hell do you think you are keeping these doors open, and the temperature so low inside.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I'm the guy who bought you dinner.\"  \n\n\nI watched him go over to my now cousin-in-law and grab his coat and almost pull her out the front door.  \n\n\nI thought one of my Groomsmen was going to burst he laughed so hard.",

                "sent": "I'm 39.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#1. Life is work. \n\nEverything requires perpetual maintenance. All elements of your life, be they self-care, friendships, relationships, work-life balance, health, your house, your car, bank accounts, etc. require **constant** repair. This is our attempt at slowing down entropy. We'll never stop it, as the [energy of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2iTCm0xpDc) is constantly trying to seek perfect equilibrium, and our efforts only last a lifetime. If you wish to be even *remotely* successful in life, you will recognize how much work you will need to put into every little thing. Otherwise, you'll end up like me: alone, unloved, unhealthy, and ready to die at a moment's notice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#2. \"Know thyself.\"\n\nIf you don't know who you are, you're gonna have a bad time. You need to understand that your life is HEAVILY impacted by various forms of luck: where you live; how much money your family has; how abusive your family is; the school system's resources; the literal air that you are breathing. These all have an impact on your life, and the possibility of your future life. The opportunities or obstacles of your life are LARGELY dictated by simple factors of luck. Not all, but I'll get to that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#3. \"Be yourself\"...is horseshit.\n\nIf you don't know who you are, *how the hell can you be yourself\u203d* How do you overcome this catch-22? \n\nA better variant, IMO, is ***\"be the person you wish to become\"***. Not a living or dead person that you hope to magically morph into. But the person that you, in your mind, wish to be in the future. \n\nDo you want to [be kind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sicUhD1n-es), or ruthless? Do you want to be respected, or feared? To you want to help, or hurt? Those are broad and vague, and there are many many more, but they're starting points for how to approach your future. If you've decided to be ruthless, then you'll begin to adapt behaviors that go that route. If you're a meek and timid person who can't even say their name clearly (been there, done that, relevant username now), you're not likely to command any kind of respect.\n\nIf who you are right now is not what you want to be, then \"being yourself\" is the worst advice you'll receive. You must change yourself, because whether you like it or not, change occurs, and you can't control the majority of those changes. So change the ones you *can*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#4. Friends come and go.\n\nThe reason you have friends *right now* is because of geographic (and, to a not-to-be-dismissed degree, socioeconomic) reasons. Once you stop going to the same schools, and movie theaters, and book stores, and restaurants, etc. the friendships will begin to diminish. You will more likely grow apart over time, not together. It's possible, sure. But don't make any heavy bets, because you'll lose money on those bets more often than not.\n\nYou'll need to find new ways of making friends. College is yet another school-related location that can help. Clubs help. Hobby-related activities help. \n\nRight before COVID lockdowns here in LA, I made a friend with my tattoo artist, barely knew him otherwise. He mentioned he and his friends were gonna start watching crappy 80's horror movies on the weekend. I was down. Then the lockdowns hit, and we couldn't do it. And I'm bad at making friends with new people I've barely met, so I've made no attempts to reconnect. Maybe when I get back to the tattoo shop. Goes back to point #1.\n\nMaking friends will be hard. But if you're lucky, and make enough connections, it won't be *as hard*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#5. \"Expect the best, prepare for the worst.\"\n\nHaving a positive outlook is healthy. If you're perpetually despondent, hopeless, and listless, you probably have depression, and that needs tending to. But ONLY having a positive outlook will lead you to trouble. You must prepare for the times when life throws a wrench into your car tire. Saving money is necessary. Blowing it all and wondering how you're gonna eat next week is pointless drama you've placed upon yourself. Get a checking account, a savings account, and a retirement account. Even if you only put $10 / week into the thing, AND LEAVE IT THE HELL ALONE, you'll likely have a nice rainy day fund when the shit hits the fan. \n\nLiving in a fire-prone region? make sure you have proper equipment in case wildfires become too dangerous. Earthquake kits, first aid kits, bottled water, blankets, etc. \n\nIf you don't live in a place with reliable mass transit, best make sure you have a car that's in good working order. In that car, ensure you have a fresh spare tire (replace tires every 5 years, unless otherwise indicated by professionals). Know how to change a tire: loosen those lugnuts FIRST, then jack up the car, remove tire, replace tire, tighten lug nuts with wrench, lower the car SLOWLY AND SAFELY, finish tightening lugnuts, etc. Know how to bleed brakes (get a friend to help). Replace wipers and fluid before the rainy season as needed. SO much car care is necessary, going back to point #1.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#6. Kissing ass and networking are IMPORTANT.\n\nIf you think you're going to have a *remotely* successful life, you're going to be kissing a LOT of ass. It doesn't mean completely shoving your nose up someone's ass, but sometimes it might. If you are regularly on someone's radar in a good way, especially someone with an inkling of power, you're going to be one of the first people they think of for a promotion or raise or relocation to an exotic land. You're going to have to wear a lot of \"masks\" when you're around various people. Or you could just become like me and avoid that, keep your \"self respect\", and be poor and ignored. \n\nI was \"discovered\" last year. Like, legit. I was on a podcast with a coworker (I was the interviewee), and **an executive producer of one of the nation's largest morning shows** heard the podcast. He found me a month later, talked to me, and helped me get started. He gave me a lot of advice that I never used (regarding kissing ass, etc.), because I'm a fuck up. After a month, he dropped me, told me I needed to \"be my own cheerleader\". Coulda been a host on the radio in Los Angeles, but I'm not.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#7. Hard Work & Luck.\n\nLuck starts your journey, hard work continues it. Anyone successful who doesn't say they are lucky (or outright refuses to acknowledge it) are not people to look up to. [Survivorship Bias](https://xkcd.com/1827/) is a huge factor. If you look at all the people who've worked hard and were successful, and then found everyone else who did similar, but aren't successful, you can factor in luck for the successful. Every. Single. Time. This [Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I&vl) better explains everything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#8. \"No man is an island.\"\n\nYou can't do this alone. Everyone who gets anywhere in life is doing it with the help of others. They could be supportive parents. Friends who love them for who they are. Teachers that see the possibilities. Employers who see growth. Coworkers that empower their workday. Baristas at the coffee shop with a smile. Strangers on the train who hold the door for 1 extra second (don't go nuts on this one, people, there's a threshold). If you are surrounded by supportive and loving people, life, in all its difficulties and flaws and foibles, will become much less work. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#9. Life is a game.\n\nIf you don't play, you lose. If you don't play by the rules, you lose. If you don't play well with others, you lose. No matter how much you want it or not, you're in the game. You have no choice. And your only opponent is you. Goes back to #6, and ties in with #8. And despite how shitty the game is, again, if you choose not to play, you will reap zero rewards.

I really hope anyone who will read this will take a moment to check on their friends, so many people don't and even if they want you to or not, it will make them feel more loved in the long run.\n\nPotential trigger warnings below, so just be warned. PS I love you, even if you don't love you.\n\n>!I have been suicidal for 12 years. The last 2-3 years I have been doing much much better and I don't really consider myself suicidal anymore, but for the sake of this I will include this year in the tally because I had a bad month a few months back.!<\n\n>!There have been 3 very distinct times in my life where I almost killed myself. First was when I was in high school, I started drinking every day and blacking out all the time, I did drugs and drank every day. I hated life and just wanted to feel something else. One night I was extremely wasted and decided to go walk around town. I was standing next to the road and was waiting to just jump in front of a bust or large truck. While waiting I was thinking about the reasons I didn't want to be alive. After an hour of thinking all the bad things, I started thinking about reasons I might want to be alive... This first time was because I promised myself that I wouldn't make my mom bury another child (my sister died before I was born).!<\n\n>!The second time I was 8 months out of HS, same scenario as above with all the drugs and all. This time I had a gun to my head, I was going to pull the trigger, but when I did my finger wouldn't move.  I put the gun down and cried. This time I remembered that I wanted to move away some day and see new places, I couldn't die before I left my hometown and had new experiences.!<\n\n>!The third time was my closest time. I was in college and my entire life fell apart. GF left me, lost my job, had to drop out of school, one of my pets died, I lost a good friend, my life literally collapsed around me. I took an entire bottle of pain killers, mixed an entire bottle of vodka with it and then went to sleep. I woke up 30 minutes later with the worst pain of my life. I could have just took the pain, but once I felt that, once I felt something that made me actually feel alive I called my friend. He knew I was suicidal and knew that I would probably try something soon. He was on call for me 24/7. He picked me up, forced me to throw up and then rushed me to the ER to get my stomach pumped. I decided to fight it because I actually realized that I WANT TO BE ALIVE, I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO LIVE.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!From that day on, I have tried my best to be happy, its been 3 years now, and I have only been in a slump where I was slightly suicidal for 6 days out of 3 years. My depression tried killing me, I didn't try to kill me. That is how I think about it. So now I fight my depression, instead of being my depression.!<\n\nEdit: I got so emotional writing this I forgot to mention my cat really helped me with my depression. She never leaves my side, it's like she knows I need a guardian of some sort.",
